my masters im worried theyll get screwed up please dont tell me

personal politics more important than smcapboldfontgod
ptthe lawsmcapboldfont

 thats irrelevant problem here windows came my
system disks i hate using disks so i copied
them over high density s using xcopy worked fine 
fact while i changing configurations whatnot so much
 i decided try putting them hard disk only can you
copy them over one disk per directory you want you
can simply copy them all one directory makes lot nicer
when youre switching printer emulations around

norton i dont have much experience when friends
system crashed we restored from backup rather than from 
originals worked fine would imply arj r norton
cnu would create workable backup you did full install
 first time youve got whole thing

never played wp windows im too big fan anything
from utah

good luck
