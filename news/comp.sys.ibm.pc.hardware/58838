since ive been seeing all kinds complaints regarding gateways
lately here i thought i post my recent pleasant experiences my
machine dxv past friday two weeks day from
when i called order 

 upon unboxing i found everything perfect order all 
peripherals i ordered were properly installed jumbo cdrom i
 very impressed quantity quality gateway 
documentation all software came original disks manuals
 gateway manual itself nice ring binder ati gup came
 build drivers all other software i specified microsoft office
 properly installed machine came right up out box 
has been performing flawlessly its been all weekend hardly
even reaches room temperature i think big roomy tower case has 
lot do 

 its up running dos problems ive also read about
some people having problems high speed serial communications 
i used dos interlink program which lets me link my old
computer via serial port k baud maps other
machines two hard disks my disks f g you can cd 
drives either run programs copy files its almost like 
peerpeer lan except you can also run programs other machine
its two way street other machine server 
machine client so thats where seems differ from 
peer peer stuff bundled dos utility its very impressive 

 my jumbo took about minutes back up mb data i also
bypassed any potential gateway monitor problems taking 
credit applying towards nec fg i love monitor

 so im glad some good news gateway stories im glad 
 me now just keeps working
