i own stealth card from diamond when using xxmil win 
driver card driver work very fast all other
windows drivers have number bugs shadows remain when windows 
erased text boxes often unreadable all attempts get help from
diamond have failed i have called tech support never been able
 get past hold line toll call reasonable time ie min
leaving voice mail has helped either bbs joke always
has too many people download anything you cannot even get file
listing considers download i have faxed tech support group
all reponse

 bottom line you looking fast card want use 
 windows do get diamond product try another vendor i wish i had

while others here may have had better experiences i too share 
sentiments posted above though i have original stealthvram
 only relatively recent windows drivers card
have evolved point decent performance note 
still couple modes i cannot use ie due shadowing
misdrawn check boxes etc i believe version i have 
 theres more recent release id appreciate someone would
drop me note let me know i havent been able get 
bbs lately check again naturally diamond doesnt even bother
notifying me fixesreleases

diamond helpful when i finally reached right person curing
some my windows problems due address conflict conflicting
addresses e e were omitted least my version 
diamondvram manual i hope has been corrected now tech rep
explained all sbased boards use addresses i have 
confirmed validity statement

when i upgrade my motherboard near future hopefully some
form local bus ill seek video solution from someone other than
diamond
