hi i recently switched my old amiga dx my computer
configuration 

dx mhz kb eisa micronics motherboard asic eisa mhz
mb ram
stn mb harddisk scsi
ultrastorf eisa cache controller

when i use norton harddisk benchmark i get harddisk data transfer
about kbsec sometimes mbsec good i thought
 eisa i could get about mbsec 
somewhere manual my harddisk i have read some host 
adapters need perform lowlevel format optimize harddisk 
performance system do i need 
 guy i know gets hd transfer about mbsec he has sta 
 isa dx how can isa same system faster 

 anything i can do get speedier harddisk 


 dont rely benchmarks often show incorrect due different
 tsr programs

 scsi often needs driver get speed from card

 make sure card operating synchronus mode which x faster

 you can disable disconnect get some kbs just loose mouse
 other ints when diskaccesing

i get mbs dx lb scsi lb maxtor lxtsy coretest
i get mbs sysinfo
