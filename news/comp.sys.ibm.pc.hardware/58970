hello i hope somebody out here can help me i am currently working
 project where i am trying communicate from ibm 
phoenix bios using c board i made intel cpu
 uart chip board works fine transmit command 
terminal emulation mode kermit seems something wrong
 initialization protocol used when i try c i need 
access unit i built using c because i have sizable chunk c
code i using perform calculations operations 
 very difficult code assembly language 

i have included assembly code i am running c code
 i am trying use anyone can show me something i
am doing blatantly incorrectly i am missing because my lack
 knowledge about rs serial communications please email me
i wrote assembly language wait character received 
 check against x character x received 
 leds indicate two c programs i have written do
nothing set up com port send x character one uses
 bioscom function biosh other uses software interrupt
int function dosh i have triple checked baud rate 
 parity none stop bits character length bits 
 interrupt calls x currently i am loss 
 what may wrong any hardware gurus out want comment


thanks alot
