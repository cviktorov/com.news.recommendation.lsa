 questions can answered any dealer ibm value points i 
provide some unsolicited advice most amusing kind advice

today tueday ibm supposed officially announce introduction
 vesa local bus value point systems systems still have onboard
video disk which far better than prior value point systems 
you get vesa local bus future upgrades we going buy three 
them monitors also newly available one three 
immediately upgraded ultrastor f caching scsi disk controller 
either ati gup viper graphics board

do buy sx sytem

my personal philosophy upgrade policy lossfree when
you earn money you pay taxes when you spend money you pay taxes ie 
get you coming going translated means take infrequent large
steps you far better off short term long term you avoid sx
models go straight dx dx models
