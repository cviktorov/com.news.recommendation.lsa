does do all tapes were two tapes unwound same
type from same batch reason i ask i bought some generic tapes
 did found tape markers were fully punched out 
had closed little marker hole only few tapes set

did you open up tape cartridge put tape back reels

 you have yet open up removing two screws bottom 
 tape cartridge snap plastic shell away from metal base 
 you pulling tape through assembly try touch any more 
than you have you doing look couple little holes 
 tape marker holes which let tape drive know when 
 end tape holes spaced couple inches apart my best
guess drive finds first marker stops second
marker 

anyhow tape has holes check see mirror tape
 clean function mirror detect marker holes 
tape drive shines light mirror has pickup area where
 reflection would come out when hole goes pickup detects 
light allowed pass knows when stop mirror dirty
 out alighment unlikely since made case you might have
 problem detecting end tape

 tape drive does all tapes tapes all look good either
 pickup led sensor system has failed dirty you open
 drive door you see sensor assembly left rw head
assembly looks clean nothing its way drive may
need serviced possible led burned out sensor
 out 

 still warranty you might able send back cms 
repair
