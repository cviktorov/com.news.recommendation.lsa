 try bios level format via debug command
 gxxxx where xxxx hex address hd controller bios
 location
 work last resort would take large magnet
 hard disk has done properly you cause
 could cause more damage than has been done already

 large magnet your hard disk

 done correctly magnet trick wipe out everything 
 hard disk completely low level bios format might succeed
