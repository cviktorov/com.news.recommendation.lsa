 doesnt answer original question os multiuser os
 mention made ether card either from diskdata
point view why does scsi have advantage when comes multi
tasking data data could anywhere drive can
scsi find faster can get off drive computer
faster does have better cache system i thought scsi good 
managing data bus when multiple devices attached we 
only talking about single drive explain why scsi inherently
faster managing data from hard drive
you making same mistake i did you confusing drive
interface data throughput interface again from my mac ibm info
sheet available ftp sumexaimstanfordedu 
infomacreport macibmcomparetxt
expansion
both mac ibm
scsi only external device expansion interface common both mac ibm
 allows use any device hard drive printer scanner nubus card 
 expansion mac plus only some monitors cdrom apple developed some 
 specifications scsi controlers while ibm has exact controller 
 specifications which results added incompatibilities ibm machines 
 main problem lot external devices which internal 
 terminated which causes problems more two devises off scsi port 
 scsi chain supposed terminated only begining 
 end any other set up causes problems either mac ibm 
scsi devices per scsi controller bit asynchronous mbs ave
 synchronous mbs max transfer base bit scsi requires 
 scsi controler chip can provide only fast scsi wide scsi
 which both bit interfaces see scsi
scsi devices per scsi controller scsi mode scsi fully
 scsi complient tends implimented very fast scsi since 
 needs different controller interface both hardware which tends 
 very expendsive software transfer speeds mbs mbs burst 
 bit mbs mbs burst bit mbs mbs burst
 bitwide fast scsi scsi mode limited devices 
 reduced bit bit fast only throughput due difference between
 scsi wide scsi ports

ibm
hd interfaces limited hard drives design lack development

ide integrated device electronics 
 currently most common standard mainly used medium sized 
 drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer mbs max

so its lowest setting scsi interface asynchronous scsi mode averages 
 through put maximum ide asynchronous mode full scsi mode
 blows poor ide out window down street garbage can
 problem becomes can drive mechanisim keep up those through put
rates where bottleneck cost scsi comes from 
 interface itself more more from drive mechanisims use 
scsi through put cost scsi interface self fulliling
prophisy few people buy scsi because so expencive pc which
 turn convices makes mass producing scsi which would reduce its
cost unwarented so scsi expencive effect 
rule scale more items sold less each item has bare brunt
 cost manufacture so less each item has cost

scsi allows drive mechanisims through put limited drive while
ide itself limits through put
