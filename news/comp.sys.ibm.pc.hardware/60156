i never thought id contribute gateway thread either pro con 
my spleen could use little venting scenario

 ordered dx w ultrastor f local bus hd controller
 receive system days after ordering happy
 discover ultrastor f isa hd controller inside unhappy
 call gateway receive correct controller days 
getting happier
 new controller doesnt work unhappy again
 call gateway again get another controller more days
cooling off end sight
 controller doesnt work either motherboard bad
very unhappy

gateways solution order me new motherboard more days
 have onsite service install me
 i have take day off work because service people
only work mf i say way ive already blown about hours
 about them hold i dont have time 
 take day off work also my day return period almost over 
ive only been able use thin about minutes so whole 
thing going back 
 i extremely upset when i began post because support rep told me
 i would have pay shipping only returned system also
 two hard drive controllers had sent me fortunately i just spoke
 customer service going have ups come pick everything
up gratis only downside now i have order another computer

i would really like try gateway again im just very turned off 
prospect having try get through customer service tech support
again i think products great most part im
beginning wonder savings worth potential aggravation
 other mail order companies difficult contact i know gateway 
booming good reason i dont know i can take again
oh well i feel better now
