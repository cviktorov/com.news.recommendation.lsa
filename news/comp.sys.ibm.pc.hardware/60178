point view why does scsi have advantage when comes multi
tasking data data could anywhere drive can
scsi find faster can get off drive computer
faster does have better cache system i thought scsi good 
managing data bus when multiple devices attached we 
only talking about single drive explain why scsi inherently
faster managing data from hard drive

ide integrated device electronics 
 currently most common standard mainly used medium sized 
 drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer mbs max

why dont you start specsheet isa bus first
you can quote scsi specs till youre blue face 
exceed isa bus capability whats point

who says ide limited megssec what about vlbide does anyone
know how perform

so its lowest setting scsi interface asynchronous scsi mode averages 
 through put maximum ide asynchronous mode full scsi mode
 blows poor ide out window down street garbage can

 implimented what system 

 problem becomes can drive mechanisim keep up those through put
rates where bottleneck cost scsi comes from 
 interface itself more more from drive mechanisims use 
scsi through put 

given original question scsi used only single hard drive
controller necessary get scsi drive do
 least maybe megssec scsi choice make any sence
what does meg megssec scsi drive cost

 cost scsi interface self fulliling
prophisy few people buy scsi because so expencive pc which
 turn convices makes mass producing scsi which would reduce its
cost unwarented so scsi expencive effect 
rule scale more items sold less each item has bare brunt
 cost manufacture so less each item has cost

 original cga cart back i think original ega card
 pga scsi has stood relatively alone coming down
 price mainly because were talking about pcs suns sparc
 sgi name your favorite unix workstation after millions
 pc buying decisions over years scsi has had plenty time 
come down price

i wont argue scsi standard makes good well implimented
data highway i still want know why intrinsically better
than ide isa bus when comes multitasking oss when
managing data from single scsi hard drive
