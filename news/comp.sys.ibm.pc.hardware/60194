 i have spg io card my pc 
 when i plug wang modem comit works i change
 com doesnt 
 program chkport gives diagnostics like possible com irq
 conflict com mouse driver memory
 
 since your iocard only has one serial port should default com 
 under msdos you cant share irqs so youll have set either your modem
 your mouse com using different adresses irqs
 when you set two devices onto same irq like com com 
 latter one always win ie you have your mouse com 
 start using your modem com your modem should work your mouse 
 stop doing so until reboot
 
 should problem setting your modem com you didnt write 
 anything about other peripherals 
 
 i hope helped bit byte oli
