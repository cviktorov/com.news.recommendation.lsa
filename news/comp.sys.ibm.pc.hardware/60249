 pc magazine april although scsi twice fasst esdi
 faster than ide support up devices its acceptance has 
long been stalled incompatability problems installation headaches
 
i love when magazine writers make stupid statements like re 
performance where do get those numbers ill list actual
performance ranges which should convince anyone 
statement absurd 
scsii ranges from mbs 
scsiii ranges from mbs 
ide ranges from mbs 
esdi always mbs although some nonstandard versions
all shows you dont know much about scsi

scsi scsi controler chip range indeed mbs
 all you have right about scsi
scsi scsi controller chip mbs mbs burst bit
 note increase speed mac quadra uses version scsi
 so does exist some pc use set up too
scsi bitscsi mode mbs mbs burst
scsi bitwide fast mode mbs mbs burst
scsi bitwide fast mbs mbs burst
 
 your own data although scsi twice fast esdi correct
 scsi controller chip scsi can reach mbs which indeed
 faster than ide all scsi facts have been
posted newsgroup my mac ibm info sheet available ftp 
sumexaimstanfordedu infomacreport 
macibmcompareversion txt should may still 

part problem both mac ibm pc inconsiant about what scsi
 which though well documented quadra has scsi chip
 apple salesperson said uses fast scsi chip mbs
mbs burst does scsi mbs maximum synchronous quadra
uses ansynchronous scsi which slower seems mac ibm see
scsi interface think scsi when maybe scsi interface driven
 machine scsi controller chip bit mode which much
faster true scsi can go

dont slam article because you dont understand what going 
one reference quadras scsi controller chip
