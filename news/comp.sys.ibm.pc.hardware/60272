 oh yeah i just read another newsgroup ti uses 
 high quality trinitron tube than most monitorsthe sony
 s example where extra cost comes from 
 also where high bandwidth comes from fantastic
 image large image size etc etc
 
 its also where two annoying lines across screen one third
 down other two thirds down come from
 

 lines result high end trinitron tube 
 wires found all trinitron tubes eg mitsubishi 
sony etc sony tubes youll find one wire

 level annoyance purely subjective im so happy 
sharpness ti i dont even notice lines

 ti uses trinitron sa tube which when viewed complete tube
has larger diameter than standard trinitron tube results 
 flatter screen than other monitors using standard trinitron 
which has vertically flat horizontally flat surface 
apparently ability provide tighter beam focus
