 partitions take up disk space having partition cost
 somewhere between meg hard disk space you can afoord 
 luxury more power you its your choice
 

 where does all disk space go dos partition table fixed length
 every hard disk carries one what useing lost mb

 i remember right partition table allocated entire cylinder
 find out how much takes up you need calculate
heads sectors 

 also you create extended partition second partition
 logical drives

i think original respondent guy dawson refering something
much more elementary

every partition whether entire disk has two fats 
 initial directory

 you have small disk meg less i would recommend remain
 single partition unless you have some other consideration

 you have large disk greater than meg multiple partitions can
make sense
