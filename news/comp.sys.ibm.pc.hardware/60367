 why dont you start specsheet isa bus first
 you can quote scsi specs till youre blue face 
 exceed isa bus capability whats point

who said isa necessary eisa vlb only interfaces worth
investing thousands dollars eg new pcs worth money 

 dont complain maybe wasnt you scsi so expensive 
pcs because all weve had until year two ago isa bus
ie one buys scsi isa because isa slow
 you saying scsi isa bus automatic winner when
compared ide

you didnt read carefully vlbide uses same connection mechanism
 standard ide transfer rate limited ide whether its
interfaced isa eisa vlb matters 

i get different transfer rates out my ide when i change my isa bus speed

 mine one thing scsi blows ide out water hands down 
ide has better throughput why isnt used workstations file
servers 

ide just variant old ibm mfm controller least thats
how looks from software point view never meant 
 allencompassing protocalstandard implimented across different
platforms

 any argument 
ide can cant transfer data from ide drive least fast 
drive able provide data scsi versions ide drives able
 deliver higher sustained transfer rates scsi interface because
 higher rpm platter different arrangement heads etc

 given original question scsi used only single hard drive
 controller necessary get scsi drive do
 least maybe megssec scsi choice make any sence
 what does meg megssec scsi drive cost

 thats nice thing multitasking os scsi can use both drives
 once ive got unix loaded one my pcs along windogs os can only use one two ide drives one time its pretty ugly

 data going from one drive another scsi has ability 
perform transfer without data having go through cpu main
memory yes optimal way do far i know ide
cant do when cpu wants data from both drives data stored
 main memory you saying scsi can grab data from both drives 
 same time storetransfer data main memory also 
same time working off irq dma channel isa whatever bus

i just bought quantum my mac home i paid i
havent seen ide drives cheaper

 friend mine just got maxtor meg ide drive thats 
million bytes megabytes basic interface he gets
close megsec transfer his does your figure include few
hundred scsi drivers

 actually were talking about scsi being expensive simply because
nobody did common interface pc had common read
easily implemented method adding scsi pc like sun 
mac youd find scsi connection medium choice

so youre saying scsi would have been default interface type
considering vast majority pcs dont have cdrom drives 
tape backups etc most pcs only have had hard drive 
run dos scsi hard drives cost lot more than mfm rll drives
 time how common were scsi drives under megs years
ago theres lot more than lack common interface card 
prevented scsi from becoming connection medium choice

 i wont argue scsi standard makes good well implimented
 data highway i still want know why intrinsically better
 than ide isa bus when comes multitasking oss when
 managing data from single scsi hard drive

 single drive scsi more expensive

 point faster what all about do you
get more performance money all people only have
 single hard drive system regardless os scsi
choice really give them more performance than ide

 you bought your pc 
expandibility so youd want add more drives whatever

true expandibility can also start bus which means option
 cdrom drives tape backups run off own cards

 you can add many different types devices access them 
concurrently

 argument always held up first time scsi buyer 
best reason how many scsi devices first time scsi buyer
eventually acquire again does make sense go scsi single
hard drive system

 scsi device works many different machines i have mac
 pc home moving hard drives between them very nice
 scsi hook them up away go

 all postings scsi i ii specs you really sure 
pc apple scsi hard drives compatible even 
 data accessible from either machine ie formatting
partitioning file table differences really plugnplay

 scsi devices work together better than ide devices 
instance recently i added older connor meg ide maxtor
 meg ide connor must setup slave 
work other way scsi you set address check 
termination plug away goes

so c drive connor becomes logical d drive dos 
really problem 

 i have problem ides mutual exclusion i notice 
 time takes switch from accessing drive c drive d 
quite long compared time takes switch from drive c
 d scsi system under multitasking os very
noticable many things can going once

after having two ide drives my system temporary file transfers
i have never seen any differences when switching between drives nor
have i ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives 
tofrom same drive

one neat thing ive noticed lately fringe benefit has been 
ability add older almost dead drives storage scsi system 
little problem weve got bunch almost dead meg drives ive
added my pc ive now got interface full does allow me 
have meg drives meg drive tape drive meg drive
all same card 

 nice long power supply can keep up i do believe 
 possibility up ide drives pc

simply put scsi handier than ide mysterious jumpers figure out

 what about mysterious expensive drivers figure out least
ide doesnt require drivers consume precious conventional dos memory
