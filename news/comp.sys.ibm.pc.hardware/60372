 i wont argue scsi standard makes good well implimented
 data highway i still want know why intrinsically better
 than ide isa bus when comes multitasking oss when
 managing data from single scsi hard drive

i have been following thread figured id throw my two cents

 amiga zorro ii bus comparable isa bus vs mhz
 amiga has had preemptative multitasking os since can
operate mb ram scsi used almost exclusively systems

 scsi controller transfers data dma allows cpu request data
from hard drive continue working while controller gets data
 moves memory controller allows reselection can operate
even better multiple devices espically true scsi tape
units example when rewinding formatting tape command 
issued controller bus released allow access other
devices bus greatly increases productivity least do
something else while backing up your hard drive which happens 
what i am doing while reading group

its long story i still use ide my except cdrom which
thanks scsi i can move between both machines when scsi 
better standardized supported ibmclone machines i plan 
completely get rid ide

 wayne summer amiga simply best
