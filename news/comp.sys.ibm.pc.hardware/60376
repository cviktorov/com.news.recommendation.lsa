 i still want know why intrinsically better
 than ide isa bus when comes multitasking oss when
 managing data from single scsi hard drive

 scsi controller transfers data dma allows cpu request data
from hard drive continue working while controller gets data
 moves memory 

ide also uses dma techniques i believe floppy controller also uses dma
 most ad boards also use dma dma big deal has nothing 
do directly scsi

 example when rewinding formatting tape command 
issued controller bus released allow access other
devices bus greatly increases productivity least do
something else while backing up your hard drive which happens 
what i am doing while reading group

you can thank your software dos had few more brains 
could format floppies etc while you were doing something else 
hardware support dos least wont again has 
nothing do scsi

its long story i still use ide my except cdrom which
thanks scsi i can move between both machines when scsi 
better standardized supported ibmclone machines i plan 
completely get rid ide

 you stick dos youll wonder why you cant multitask

again i ask why cant unix os type os do all miraculous things
 ide harddrive can single scsi hard drive
