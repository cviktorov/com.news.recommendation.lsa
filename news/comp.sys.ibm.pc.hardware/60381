i just bought quantum my mac home i paid i
havent seen ide drives cheaper

 friend mine just got maxtor meg ide drive thats 
million bytes megabytes basic interface he gets
close megsec transfer his does your figure include few
hundred scsi drivers
since mac uses only scsi hard drives yes figure includes 
hundred scsi drivers sloppy people dumb

 point faster what all about do you
get more performance money
ok once again scsi spec list
scsi scsi controler chip synchronous range indeed mbs
 asynchronous range slower mbs
scsi scsi controller chip mbs mbs burst bit
 note increase speed mac quadra uses version scsi
 so does exist some pcs use set up too

scsi bitscsi mode mbs mbs burst
 those who want scsi dont want pay bit bit
 hardware mess scsi software controllers usable scsi
 devices close bit scsi speeds
scsi bitwide fast mode mbs mbs burst
scsi bitwide fast mbs mbs burst

 other interfaces let dxbpsuvmpsuedu speak
ide ranges from mbs 
again synchronous asynchronous modes asynchronous much slower
 range mbs
esdi always mbs although some nonstandard versions

one problem inconsitant use term scsi articles 
people its proper meaning set scsi interfaces composed 
scsi scsi
look inconsitant use scsi below quote
my comments 

pc magazine april although scsi twice fast esdi
 asynchronous scsi scsi chip faster than ide
 both asynchronous scsi scsi chip bit scsi
 read consitantly quote should read
asynchronous scsi scsi chip
although asynchronous scsi twice fast esdi one third 
speed ide
 asynchronous scsi scsi chip bit scsi
although scsi scsi chip bit scsi eight times fast 
esdi faster than ide

note nonuse scsi itself eliminates ambaguity

scsi drivers somewhat reasonable while bit bit scsi drivers 
 very expansive bit scsi can use scsi drivers little speed
degridationthe mac quadra does exactly 

 we continue thread state clearly which scsi you talking 
about scsi scsi scsi over all scsi scsi
 does make difference
