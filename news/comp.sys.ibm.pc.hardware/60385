can anyone tell me card works march os beta

 i believe so since buslogic cards have proven very 
reliable os 

 buslogic cards have os driver does work march 
beta support buslogic cards included os any longer
 you wish install beta from cdrom you need rem out 
adaptec device drivers have nasty tendency crash buslogic
cards when os attempts use them thanks adaptec 

so you add buslogic drivers configsys cdrom boot disk 
rem out adaptec drivers

 you install whole st half beta wont work ibm
nicely copies adaptec drivers once again thanks ibm so rem out
 adaptec drivers once more reboot you have everything 
right order work

things pretty smooth through rest installation except os
 try install adaptec scsi drivers once again end so you
 off more rem statements more fun 

 bt bk comes drivers costs same adaptec cards 
do come drivers dos drivers work great card can easily 
configured work different sets io ports you can use
multiple host adapters one machine you get new card also 
able support up gb drives under dos

hope helps
