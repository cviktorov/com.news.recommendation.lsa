since mac uses only scsi hard drives yes figure includes 
hundred scsi drivers sloppy people dumb
what group mac group
nice you delete both your responce item prompted 
 whit
i just bought quantum my mac home i paid i
 
havent seen ide drives cheaper
 which you responded
 friend mine just got maxtor meg ide drive thats 
million bytes megabytes basic interface he gets
close megsec transfer his does your figure include few
hundred scsi drivers
 which i correctly pointed out following 
since mac uses only scsi hard drives yes figure includes 
hundred scsi drivers sloppy people dumb
 i said sloppy dumb you should resounded discounting mac
 giving maxtor meg ide drive example giving 
example you give implied consent mac info included
 scsi discusion

ok once again scsi spec list
why spec list again we talking scsi pc mac 
 unix box we talking isa bus possibly eisa vlb
ok i do v e r y s l o w l y so you can understand
reguardless whether mac pc scsi scsi different
from each other asynchronous synchronous scsi all 
have different speeds costs lumping them all together scsi 
dumb sloppy take again quote later example problem 
 pc world spec list so you knew where numbers were
coming from article shows article correct 
staments about scsi consitant

 isint compperiphsscsi
 way thread has gone how do you tell 
tell me what performance figures single scsi drive pc
 isa eisa vlb bus
already gave them you keep deleting them so here specs
 everybody again some added info

scsi scsi controler chip asynchronous range mbs
 synchronous range mbs both common pc world difference 
 mainly software hardware

scsi scsi controller chip also called scsi bit mbs 
mbs burst advertised scsi byte 
 pc speedsnot mac pc

i have seen following either mac pc
scsi bitwide fast mode mbs mbs burst
scsi bitwide fast mbs mbs burst

 other interfaces let dxbpsuvmpsuedu speak
ide ranges from mbs 
 asynchronous range mbs infered from byte 
 synchronous range mbs
esdi always mbs although some nonstandard versions

theoretical performance figures relevant group 
debate im sure some platforms out can
handle megssec scsi xyz widenfast pc isint one 
them
note i also give average through put scsi which holds true
 mac ibmpc clone correct hardware software
 since pc adversizements using theoretical performance figures why 
cannot we

 we continue thread state clearly which scsi you talking 
about scsi scsi scsi over all scsi scsi
 does make difference

well maybe scsi design people had act together than maybe
all pcs would have built scsi ports now
 pc articles like following obvious problem 
scsi people who report like you
look inconsitant use scsi below quote 
my comments 
although scsi twice fast esdithis asynchronous scsi 
 scsi chip faster than ide both asynchronous scsi 
 scsi chip bit scsi pc magazine april 
 article confused scsi term mess from inconsitant use
 because interface itself mess

scsi means set scsi interfaces composed scsi scsi
 scsi some people want use 

 read consitantly quote should read
asynchronous scsi scsi chip
although asynchronous scsi twice fast esdi one third 
speed ide
 asynchronous scsi scsi chip bit scsi
although scsi scsi chip bit scsi eight times fast 
esdi faster than ide

note nonuse scsi itself eliminates ambaguity

 we continue thread state clearly which scsi you talking 
about scsi scsi scsi over all scsi scsi lumping
everything scsi scsi sloppy wrong dumb inconsitant
scsi scsi usage also problem clean up now have
 mess like svga several years ago because everybody his uncle
slapped scsa own monitor inteface scsi standarized unlike
svga years ago except terminaology
