im using inth read my joystick hideously slow something
like my cpu time being spent reading joystick 
 program does nothing printf joyread

 you only do readprint reason joystick stuff
 take time even efficient

 problem lot programs trap inth like smartdrv 
so slow hell interface can i read joystick port 
 reasonably safe fashion via polling isnt platform 
clockspeed specific

 truth int h joystick reading slow i read directly
from hardware port note doing so exposes you intermittent
disturbance from interrupts so you may want read say twice 
row keep lower results dont just turn interrupts off may
prove detrimental health any high speed comms other
devices

here example how do 

 joyc 

 example how read pc joystick port polling hardware port
 directly
 uses inpoutp byte port access
 timeout when int count counts up zero
 sample reads one port presented b comments
 you can read both once merging two time out
 when either joystick connected
 
 need optimize routine since runs long 
 joystick circuitry needs
