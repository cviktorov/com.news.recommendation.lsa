we had same issue plague us months our gateway i finally
got tired so i permanently interchanged drives only
reason i didnt do first place because i had several
bootable s some based install disks which expected
 drive i order all new software upgrades 
 number stupid install programs cant handle alternate
drive declining time ones i had now upgraded 
 bootable s i just cut replacements

 switching drives option you might able wire up
 drive switch your computer chasis i havent tried i think
 would work long wired carefully

i did i use relay radio shack pdt instead huge
switch way relay breaks my drives still work

 works fine you may still need change cmos before 
drive switch work correctly some programs
