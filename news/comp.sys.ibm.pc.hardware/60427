 point view why does scsi have advantage when comes multi
 tasking data data could anywhere drive can
 scsi find faster can get off drive computer
 faster does have better cache system i thought scsi good 
 managing data bus when multiple devices attached we 
 only talking about single drive explain why scsi inherently
 faster managing data from hard drive

 adaptec series use bus mastering means cpu
doesnt sit waiting data bytes can go off do other
computing you have advanced multitasking os dos
just sits waits anyway


 ide integrated device electronics 
 currently most common standard mainly used 
 medium sized drives can have more than one hard drive
 asynchronous transfer mbs max

 why dont you start specsheet isa bus first
 you can quote scsi specs till youre blue face 
 exceed isa bus capability whats point

 who says ide limited megssec what about vlbide does anyone
 know how perform

why dont you start specsheet isa bus first ide
 designed plug isa virtually unaided essence ide 
isa ribbon cable therefore its specs same isa 
mhz clock bit width mbsec

 why ive concluded ide vlbus waste fast
slot cards job would slow vlbus transactions isa
speed heck thats what isa slots do ill just use one those
instead
