 i still want know why intrinsically better
 than ide isa bus when comes multitasking oss when
 managing data from single scsi hard drive
 
 scsi controller transfers data dma allows cpu request data
 from hard drive continue working while controller gets data
 moves memory 

 ide also uses dma techniques i believe floppy controller also uses dma
 most ad boards also use dma dma big deal has nothing 
 do directly scsi

ide does do dma because its like te pc hard disk
interface controller moves sector some buffer memory 
controller card cpu moves data from buffer main
memory where its needed ide doesnt work way its 
compatible

heck ide used dma youd hear all kinds complaints about
isa bus systems more than m ram working ide
drives m dma addressing limit isa bus ide
did dma would trouble

btw dmaenabling signals ide cable spec 
last report i heard never implemented because 
would require different kind ide adapter different drivers
