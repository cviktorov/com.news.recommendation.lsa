stuff about connection between ide ida deleated
mhz clock bit width mbsec
 ide speed come from ida where does mbs sighted ide come from

scsi complex just way industry uses talks about 
 three key differences scsi controller chip port 
 software 
let us look scsi from stand point

scsi asynchronous synchronous modes software scsi driver only
 asynchronous slower synchronous mode only mbs vs mbs
 synchronous speeds can reached most scsi divices 
 rewrite software driver case mac quadra

scsi bit main source confusion differs from
 scsi only controler chip most machines mac some pcs
 called fast scsi because uses scsi ports software drivers
 can produce scsi speeds through scsi inspite even 
 slower asynchronous mode average speed asynchronous scsi mode 
 mbs mbssee both quadras higher end pcs synchronous
 mode just allows higher burst rate mbs

scsi bit two versionswidefast wide scsi requires two things
 over bit scsi scsi software driver wide scsi port 
 machine external device
 fast scsi also requires two things over bit scsi scsi driver
 software recieving devise support bit fast scsi
 speed both same mbs mbs burst

scsi bit also know wide fast scsi over bit scsi 
 requires scsi driver software wide scsi port recieving
 devices also have bit mode scsi chip expected very
 expencive speed mbs mbs bursts
 

 i said simple seven versions scsi seperated software 
controler chip port standarize software drops 
only five versions scsi seperate only hardware chip port
