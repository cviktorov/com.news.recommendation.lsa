 too said nanao ti best monitor get 
you had money also said mitsubishi diamond pro
 next best choice has superb picture quality
 monitor can had around 

has anyone actually seen any 

i am responsible choosing standard components my company part
 my review i got viewsonic mitsubishi nanao fis i picked
 fi even though costs more than other two choices because 
has best clarity text fuzzy all viewsonic 
worst mitsubishi much better nanao fi blows both 
them out water i dont understand why nanao so much better 
since one would think mitsubishi its trinitron tube would
 better i can only imagine nanao ti must incredible 
 beter than fi

one monitors i reviewed june issue windows magazine 
 mitsubishi i also reviewed new nanao fiw which has just
been released last year may issue windows i reviewed
several monitors including nanao ti theres question 
nanao monitors best available year just were last
year difference between my ranking best windows 
ranking windows sources due mainly difference testing
criteria scoring i used different tests than did i
scored differently theres nothing wrong mitsubishi 
scored very highly my tests few points shy perfect

incidentally one things everyone should do when theyre reading
reviews any product whether its monitors mice read 
criteria methodology carefully unless you know how product
testing done what scores based you cant possibly
know what really mean just seeing i rank monitor differently
from windows sources meaningless without knowing how we did 
ranking likewise its impossible tell whether monitor meet
your needs unless you know how we did testing after all some 
what we do may apply you likewise some what we do may apply
more closely one review than another you cant always tell
anything from reading so words commentary we write you
dont also understand scoring
