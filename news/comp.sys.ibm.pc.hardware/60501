whats funny when we really can buy product probably wont
seem mouthwatering does today what holograms get outta

i can wait cos ive already got accelerated card does x 
only colour you may mock me cards here quickly enough

one odd things about computer industry since you can
always wait get something better some people wait forever i know
people who have deferred updating original ibm pc decade
because every time look whats available see something better
coming down road i know people whove dumped pcs 
garage havent replaced them because theyre afraid isnt 
right time buy just gave up using computers

i only wait when difference between my current system new stuff
 big enough warrant changing instance ill upgrading my 
 dx eisa vlb board rsn performance difference under linux
 great enough worthwhile same time ill buying new
graphic card new scsi controller ill buying s card cos theyre
fast enough i have x drivers them itll have mb vram just like
 weitek card also much cheaper when affordable mb cards
arrive ill buy one

personally my system home needs new disk subsystem much
larger monitor superfast graphics board youknowwho new
cpu board i probably wont keep much more than case 
mouse come think i dont like mouse very much so
when i buy when my dream products hit market way im
gonna buy soon i have money

over last year ive done much same now i need monitor more
memory mb just aint enough gb disk gb space left oh
well stay single dont smoke you may afford year
