whats word chipset rom bug specific 
 specific brand using rockwell rockwell
chipset itself

 were assortment firmware problems pretty much
expected any faxmodem talking different fax modem
which may have also been revised new im pretty much
oblivious any current firmware problems so youll have get 
from someone else

someone else could you please comment i have just bought
 twincom dfi which has rockwell chipset wasnt cheap
so i would like hear problems im likely run 

however i can tell you stay clear any board which uses 
rockwell mpu opposed dpu internal implementation
 because mpu used speed buffering instead having 
 interface without interface number interrupts
 still same thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions like windows far i know speed buffering
works ok external modems used internal serial
port board

phew i lucky twincom internal version has one
 rockwell chips marked rcdp

 still i would like hear more above mentioned firmware
problems
