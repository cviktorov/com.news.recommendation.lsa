i almost got hernia laughing one

youll probably get one when you realize your vesa super
dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks

 anything scsi pc obsolete killed off vesa local
 any luck pc bus archeitecture doen any sbus

have you ever seen what happens when you hook busmaster controller 
 vesa local bus actually slows down your system
bus ide must real nice get shafted bucks 
extra cost scsi drive pay another scsi controller

yeah absolutely use vlb except video graphics
 ide could possibly take advantage vlb because runs 
 mhz bits do people forget ide specifically
designed interface directly isa bus weve seen
ides come out eisa xt isa now even mca all times
 bit standard running somewhere near mhz when
you run ide off vlb theres way youre running 
 mhz would burn up course same goes scsi esdi whatever
none them run cpu speed

 only way gain advantage vlb ide hook up 
 caching controller i suspect would much much better 
get software disk cache instead since you get writecaching well

because you have ide one makes ide disks big

ive seen some fuji ide drives going high g
