trying help him install ive got vested interest since
my machines busted i have use his until i get mine fixed

anyway i cant seem get bloody thing up ive managed get
one other drive up other disconnected both
 same time whenever i try thing hangs during bootup 
never gets past system test ide controllers instruction
sheet says supports two drives i think ive configured cmos
correctly powers plugged properly i even learned about 
masterslave relationship two hds supposed have didnt
know pcs were sm i think i configured jumpers
properly mb one master new mb one slave

 only thing i can think maybe im doing cabling wrong ive
tried several combinations

controller master slave
controller slave master
master controller slave

none them worked unfortunately i cant think any others

another possibility mb one already partitioned 
two seperate drives c d cmos asks c drive d
drive setup info rather than drive drive like most others
ive seen could confusing things

so i need help drive came bereft any docs except some
info cmos setup controller has little piece paper
about size index card i cannibalized cable its one
 those connector each end one middle so
 looks like serial connection now i lost
