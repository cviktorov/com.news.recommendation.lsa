windows drivers x bit x x bit
modes fonts icons start deteriorating after windows startup

unintelligible naturally i called gateway tech support inquire

 ati ultra pro simply do work true so im simply
amazed how could strange thing i would have expected

 windows i easily challenged him because ive been
running diamond x bit mode home months now i have
tested used bit mode well he backed off said
well diamond has been working those drivers much longer anyway i
just wanted see anyone else had any trouble what did about
