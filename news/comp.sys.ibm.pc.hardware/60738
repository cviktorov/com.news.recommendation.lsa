 i just bought new ide hard drive my system go one
 i already had my problem my system only had ide cable
 one drive so i had buy cable two drive connectors
 consequently have switch cables problem 
 new hard drives manual refers matching pin cable
 both pin drive itself pin ide card 
 life me i cannot figure out how tell which way plug
 cable align 

most ide drives i have dealt have had pin labeled printed
circuit board sufficient determine which side which your
ide drive does have label you can look polarization notch 
 receptacle connector drive pins receptacle
 center polarized has one rectangular notch about mm wide
positioned center one side you can identify pin follows
look pins notch top pin top right 
all drives i have seen toward power connector which pin
 pin controller well you can use same criteria look hard
 labelling any pin once you know which end pin pins
 oposite end you all set all you need do keep
 pin end connected pin end you dont even have look 
cable itself just trace pin side cable through usually 
pin cable identified different color red usually 
beware many cable makers very careful about i have seen cables
 pin being one marked red course nonpolarized connectors
 doesnt matter you can plug cable either way you decide
which side pin 

 secondly cable has like connector two ends one between them
 i figure one end goes controler other two go 
 drives does matter which i plug master drive
 which slave any help appreciated thanks

 doesnt matter what gets plugged where does matter how drives
 jumpered amongst other options two jumpers you
should concerned both drives one jumper select whether 
drive slave master master second jumper

docuementation came you drives you do have docuementation
 just call manufacturers hotline number fax number have
one kind information routinely needed people just like
yourself fax you complete info about jumpers you dont
have convenient access fax machine you can usually get voice
