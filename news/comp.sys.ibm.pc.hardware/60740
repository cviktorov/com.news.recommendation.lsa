did i once hear order date advance something like 
clock has make get date system call apparently clock
hardware interrupt bios dont do date advance automatically 
get date call notices midnight reset flag has been set 
 advances date

anybody more info

 two problems
 bios tod routine which updates bios clock uses only bit
 day increment so second wrapping clock past midnight
 get lost one calls bios read clock 
 meantime 
 bios resets day wrap indicator first get date
 call from anybody after wrap indicator has been set so
 unless first bios get date call after midnight done 
 dos kernel which only part dos which knows how 
 increment date day wrap indication normally lost
my guess kevins menu system uses bios calls read 
clock order display time hence entity which
causes day wrap indication get lost even menu system
notices day wrap which i think indicated nonzero
value al really isnt any particularly good way tell dos
about so dos can update day menu system should use
dos calls get time which would cause dos kernel do
 bios call wrap indicator would hence processed
properly possibly though menu system cant easily use dos
calls time because dos reentrant perhaps time
incrementing ofters occur while menu system inside some
other dos call
