 may very naive question any basis 
 claim cpu get hotter when computationally intensive 
 job running my friend claims little difference
 temperature idle cpu cpu running computationally
 intensive job

 first depends what idle cpu doing

im sure about dos many multitasking oss have loop like 


loop
 anything do
yes do goto loop
 goto loop


 cpu doing any work still processing instructions

ive done some asic digital design any cpu design
 would seem me fpu being used most 
 cache being accessed off chip buffersdrivers idle
 multiplier isnt multiplying barrel shifters arent shifting
microcode isnt microcoding etc means transistors arent
switching which means less power dissipated cmos which means
less heat

from what i understand pentium shuts down those sections 
cpu which arent being used order cut down heatpower
