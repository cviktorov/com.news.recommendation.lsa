 do do low level format ide drive unless you have 
 executable doing so supplied manufacturer 
 available from bbss mail mail version costs nominal
 fee

 addition masterslave jumper ide drive also
 another jumper indicate whether slave present get right

 cabling issue long pin goes pin goes 
 pin twisting swapping ide cable sure pin 
 all three components do make assumptions guesses ok
 assumptions bad

 cable jumpers correct cmos setup correct
 you may have do fdisk followed high level format
 i have never personally found necesary perhaps 
 something gone wrong data disks probably 
 i understand your predicament you probably throw salt over
 your shoulders wear funny clothes do spooky sounding chant
 while dancing around room someone said might help

good luck
