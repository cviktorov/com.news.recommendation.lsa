 what uart

i dont know exact meaning uart i think something like
universal arithmetic receiver transmitter normally older boards have
 uart board those chips generate irq every char
 received uart has internal byte buffer so 
right software installed generates irq every chars 

 what does do highspeed modems
 necessary k higher throughput

 you ran dos you dont need because dos runs only one task 
time whole cpupower could used transfer you 
running multitasking os os unix etc windows 
cpu cannot work whole time one task 

 result lost characters broken transmissions because timeouts

 only internal modems

 only diffrence internal modems have uart board
whereas external modems connected computer over serial port
which has uart board

 you have any experience higher speed modems please
 let me know what you think also any particular brand name reccomended
 cheapo clone do just well

i use zyxelb uart under coherent im very satisfied
 i think nearly everyone satisfied his own modem
