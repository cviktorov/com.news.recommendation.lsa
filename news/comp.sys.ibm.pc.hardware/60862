 may dumb question i need put hard drive my fathers
pcxt either mfm rll ide i know how hook up how do i tell
 computer geometry drive my you set bios 
i doubt thats how its done xt i thought might software 
 controller card ide card xts i saw didnt come 
any also how do i low level format once its computer assuming
 drive which needs formatting

since bios support st interface hard disks xt
 support must come from bios extension rom mfmrll hard disk
controller usually controller has rombased low level format
program common jump address c you can type gc from
debug see small table drive geometries knows about
sometimes selectable using jumpers card sometimes you
can enter them manually llf menu failing you must use 
thirdparty hd prep program like speedstor disk manager like

ide drives come formatted already since controller part 
drive mechanism itself concerns about geometry irrelevant plug
 go fdisk
