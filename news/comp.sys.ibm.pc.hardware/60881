npjust got mhz dx system am considering getting fan 
npcpu processor when running too hot touch so i think 
npfairly good idea long ago when i did some electronics training i read
npsomewhere regions within chip define junctionsgates etc
npslowly diffuse over time increases temperature hence hot
npchip goes offspec sooner

nphas anyone out got cpu fan

i work small pc oem we offer both personal professional
system line our pro machines always have cpu cooling fan dx
 dx units

npis more than type

 several manufacturers

npdo you have remove cpu from its scoket install fan

sometimes depends specific fan model

npdo all cpu fans derive power from spare drive power lines

all ones ive seen do many come y connector so you dont
have have spare connector

npanyone had any trouble cpu fans

none

npdoes anyone have any evidence cpu fans complete waste 
money

touch dx chip after its been running few minutes you wont
feel fan waste

nphow fans attached glue clips melted cheese

depends model many use clips make sure you use heat sink
grease heat transfering tape you have wasted your money

nproughly how much cooler cpu fan opposed 
without advert ive read claims f vs f

tough tell i do know chip sheds lot heat
