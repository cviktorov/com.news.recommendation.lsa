seems lot questions regarding cyrix compatible
dlc dru my info comes directly from cyrixs fast fax service
 also from installing one chips ibm model 

 dlc instruction set compatible cpu which fits dx
socket pin grid array pga dlc currently available speeds
 do have coprocessor board any
software query return coproc present i guess emulate 
coproc instructions math functions dx level without 
actual coprocessor

 internal cache dlc k cyrix literature claims hit
rate my informal tests show cache accounts performance
boost when enabled software overall performance boost from 
dx dlc about benchmarks i used were nu si 
qaplus dhrystones whetstones performance cache enabled
 about par my dx k external cpu cache which 
around performance sx computer runs noticebly faster
 dos dblspace complaining company claims os
compatibility i didnt test 

 dru chip commonly thought dru actually
 small daughterboard slightly larger than dx which contains
 logic manage clock doubler board plugs dx
pga dlc plugs board i guess board
doubles frequency apparent cpu insert wait states when 
access rest system required info available
from cyrix anyway dru available dx dx
only double clock rates you get mhz mhz dlcs
 cyrix planning do same thing dru need
 put out mhz dlc first

i also tested dlc motherboard along cyrix coprocessor k
external cache performance were about faster than still
significantly slower than actual intel dx

imho dlc great low price upgrade people who cant afford 
cant install new motherboard definitely worth what i paid 
 you need dx performance dlc wont cut im sure
about dlc i think even matches performance wont
beat any significant way

 last time i posted info about dlc people sent quite bit mail
asking where i got so here where i got mine

treasure chest peripherals advertise computer shopper

 dlc kit 



i liked chip so much i found supplier became dealer
 you interested chip email me i can fax mail you

regarding dlc itself ill post what i can
