 we talking about scsi device eg hd scsi controller
 
 we talking about scsi controller had chip upgrade
using same chip scsi controller board
we talking about scsi device eg hd scsi controller

here rewrite my mac info sheet scsi section
scsi only external device expansion interface common both mac ibm
 allows use any device hard drive printer scanner nubus card 
 expansion mac plus only some monitors cdrom normal asynchronous
 scsi mhz fast synchronous scsi mhz difference between 
 modes mainly software drivers
 main problem lot external devices which internal 
 terminated which causes problems more two devises off scsi port 
 scsi chain supposed terminated only begining end 
 any other set up causes problems either mac ibm 
scsi bit devices per scsi controller asynchronous mbs ave
 synchronous mbs max transfers bit scsi often mistaken 
 fast version scsi see scsi details
scsi fully scsi compliant scsi mode devices per scsi controller
 bit scsi implimented very fast scsi since can run using
 scsi hardware software drivers which limits devices which
 results sometimes being mistakenly consitered part scsi bit
 bit scsi require different ports electronics scsi software
 drivers from scsi which makes them more expensive than other scsi
 interfaces bit scsi seems run only synchronous mode hence term
 wide fast scsi transfer speeds mbs mbs burst bit
 mbs mbs burst bit mbs mbs burst
 bit

bit scsi biggest headache due fact only scsi 
 i know can pump scsi speeds through scsi devices software
controlers its main implimentation mac though you do see adds
 scsi mbs maximum throughput pcs since bit scsi does 
need all hardware including electonics software bit bit
scsi cheepest scsi interfaces just pop out scsi
electornics pop bit scsi electronics some people consider
bit where scsi really starts i used one them 
mbs average though put theoretical burst mbs scsi
 bit scsi
rule thumb scsin over mbs some type scsi

bit scsi can use part scsi electronics which further reduces its cost
compared bit scsi
