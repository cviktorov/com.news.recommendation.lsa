interesting would you care explain me how my soundblaster
pro card my printer card sharing irq successfully i assure
you both set irq i have problem my
computer dtk ibm clone

running msdos derivative os obviously please take note 
following what exactly happens slightly simplified
explanation

technically irq line only means device printer
adapter soundblaster modem hard disk signal cpu 
somethings happening here please take note how cpu 
programmed handle signal usually up operating system
 msdos interrupt vector used store address 
function handles each interrupt

now basic dos doesnt care whether printer reports its ready
 print some more stuff simply ignores interrupt when
dos prints looks lpt buffer theres character 
wait while check again theres copy new character 
 lpt port since irq ignored printer interrupt its
free use any other adapters case sb 

 any multitasking otherwise advanced os kind printing
approach just doesnt work more precisely wastes lot cpu
cycles hence you cant share irq lpt sb youre
running unix os whatnot

another issue sb only digitized sound uses
interrupts when sb plays plain music cpu simply tells what
 play until told otherwise digitized sound interrupt 
required notify cpu when output ends new data 
needed

you can however hook two more com ports one interrupt use
them only one time because interrupt handling routine
 same both ports can see from which port data came
from course applies some other devices like lpt well

remember greatly simplified parts i think gives 
general picture correctly enough

cheers
