 whit
i just bought quantum my mac home i paid i
 

tons stuff deleted scsi vs ide question

wow you guys really going wild ide vs scsi thing i think
its great

like lots people id really like increase my data transfer rate from
 hard drive right now i have ms mb ide drive seagate 
what i would say standard special cache i believe ide controller
card my isa 

im currently thinking about adding another hd mb mb range
 im thinking hard you should hear those gears agrinding my head
about buying scsi drive scsi future benefit i believe im getting
something like kbsec transfer right now according nu how would 
number compare i bought stateoftheart scsi card my isa pc 
 stateoftheart scsi hard drive wailingest system i could hope 
obviously money factors choice well any other what would
you want use your isa system how much would cost

along those lines what kind transfer rate could i see my ide hds i
were buy topoftheline ide caching controller my mb ms hd
 how much would cost

i actually have pas could what waste i guess would hook
up scsi hd through its scsi port which yields optimum kbsec
actually i have borrowed ms fujitsu hd hooked up through now 
own trantor hd drivers pas scsi port scsi port 
scsi port how could i tell fujitsu scsi all scsi
