hz possible i modifed driver data base so my thoughts go back
 hercules were supposed coming out vlb version 
graphite around end march i have heard precisely zero about since
 does anyone know card actually released what capabilities
 price has

 hmm your cdrom program must using some oddball vga modes

 i think trying get out end month when
 released though itll limited quantities i think 
have quite back order right now megs version come out
 bit later

 since you have viewsonic i think has khz horizontal
frequency right youre gonna love megs version can
do xx hz xx hz xx hz
xx hz can also do xx mil 
xx bit hz too bad i dont have high bandwidth 
monitor like yours most those modes need khz monitor
otherwise youll have use lower refresh rate
