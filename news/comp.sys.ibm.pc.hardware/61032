well ive installed dos three different systems without 
stacker friend installed two other systems both stacker

 single problem except perhaps some minor bugs configsys
menus

hes right ya know ive helped install dos about computers now
mine included one he bought stacker doublespace converter
 worked fine rather he sent coupon converter

 other cases ive run doublespace installation without problem
when compressing new drive compressing free space whatever else
seems work me

ofcourse we did repeat run any program called install 
 setup very sophisticated ai autoconfiguring setup 
installation program think you do what you never wanted 
do couldnt stop from doing

well i ran normal setup thing worked fine whatever thats
worth

also dblspace crap writes about slower than stacker reads about
 slower compresses about less all tests were made same
computer same disk cache same big files were used

couldnt agree more my i dont miss speed its still
faster than normal disk read would less compression
ive sacrificed favor convenience having dblspacebin
load before anything else stacker any changes your configsys
 autoexecbat meant rebooting twice so could update those

personally im waiting stacker come out implement those
hooks stuff plus defrag comes dos okay i
much prefer compress from pctools sheer bells whistles plus
defrag sooooo sloooow dblspace drive

 dos quite good reformat disks i honestly dont understand why
you had do 

ditto
