discussing use irq 

 recent article mspraguesuperiormcwbstb mike sprague writes

i number poeple thread have already written
i cant prove its true i believe lpt does 
actually use irq even though interrupt supposed 
 dedicated lpt

 put little differently

 irq de facto standard interrupt assigned used 
 printer adapter announce its completion some activity

 dos doesnt monitor irq uses other means determine when its
 time send out another byte printer

 most all hardware printer adapters have ability disable
 use irq usually merely breaking connection between
 isa pin associated driver other adapters control 
 irq line tristate driver programming just leave 
 highimpedence mode

 unfortunately lot adapter cards which use bistate
 drivers ie either assert high assert low irq lines
 rather than tristate drivers assert high assert low dont
 assert anything presence card irq line precludes
 use irq any other adapter unless physically 
 disconnected jumper

 incidentally note theres requirement card hold
 irq line low when interrupt desired were true
 you would have somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines 
 certainly isnt requirement

 nondos operating systems os nt various unices whatever 
 proper plural unix might require use irq performance
 reasons 

 sb alas one cards which uses bistate drivers
