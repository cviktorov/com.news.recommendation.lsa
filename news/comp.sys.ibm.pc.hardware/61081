diamond video cards stealth viper speedstar etc 
may have excellent specifications windows drivers 
 
come them might make windows blindingly fast 

most fellow diamond video board owners whom ive corresponded may
 may share your opinion about proprietary clocking scheme 
all those whom ive chatted have been thrilled 
windows drivers either some modes work fine others cause
strange misdrawn objects trails etc many have also voiced 
strong discontent diamonds ambivalent attitude toward os drivers

come think though i hear see lot complaints about
 ati boards too though recent word looks like build code looks
much better

does anyone have accelerated video board drivers windows
os where all modes function properly anyone anyone
