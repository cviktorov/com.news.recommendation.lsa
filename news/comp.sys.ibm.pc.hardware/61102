just got mhz dx system am considering getting fan 
cpu processor when running too hot touch so i think 
fairly good idea long ago when i did some electronics training i read
somewhere regions within chip define junctionsgates etc
slowly diffuse over time increases temperature hence hot
chip goes offspec sooner

has anyone out got cpu fan

yes

 more than type

yes seen glueon tapeon clipon oneinch square larger
my favorite inch plastic ustoyo fan i use just plopped
down top chip during opencase service

do you have remove cpu from its scoket install fan

depends mounting

do all cpu fans derive power from spare drive power lines

only manufacturer smart

anyone had any trouble cpu fans

only goes out got blanket effect which doesnt help chip life

does anyone have any evidence cpu fans complete waste money

longer system life makes good economic sense me

how fans attached glue clips melted cheese

yes well melted cheese

roughly how much cooler cpu fan opposed without

lets you touch surface rule thumb cooling solidstate

 advert ive read claims f vs f

any info appreciated

 attached fans look slick work well im bothered potential
loss cooling fan goes out least power supply fan you
can reach back every few days feel fan blowing

i prefer put stock fan off drive brackets front panel
 blow air across cpu depends lot case board layout though

onchip fans from frys electronics sf bay area about i
get stock power supply fans about
