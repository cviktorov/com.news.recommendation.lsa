come think though i hear see lot complaints about
 ati boards too though recent word looks like build code looks
much better


build still has number problemssheared fonts 
instance you have crystal fonts enabled some other problems
color darkening some others i dont use drivers 
any mode other than xx so bugs 
other modes i cant say


does anyone have accelerated video board drivers windows
os where all modes function properly anyone anyone


 honest up until now i have only found one bug 
diamond viper drivers seems innocuous

 under microsoft word select format border click
shading take look patterns pattern
has been swapped so whole list
 completely reversedlooks right onscreen take
 another machine ie gup ssx machine 
print iy showsbadly 

keep mind i use mainly xxk mode so i cant
speak others otherwise drivers seem pretty 
solid

 
whats big noisy has iq
