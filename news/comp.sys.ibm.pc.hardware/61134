 may very naive question any basis 
claim cpu get hotter when computationally intensive 
job running

i totally agree your friend since when cpu apparently idle
 still fact churning away millions instructions per second
checking keyboard input instance 

 exception cpus used laptops where cpu can
enter idle state where just preserving its current status 
doing absolutely nothing case needs hardware interrupt
 get going again

actually iapx family has halt instruction causes cpu 
cease processing instructions cpu resumes processing either being
reset receiving external hardware interrupt different
from power management facilities victor mentions course whether 
operating systems idle loop uses halt instruction another matter
entirely
