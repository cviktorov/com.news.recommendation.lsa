i am right now working mprii certified swedish standards 
low emissions hitachi superscan monitor its x up hz 
 res got good writeup image quality recent feb
issue pc magazine far i know very little fully matches nec 
image quality least according mags i cant tell any
difference between two i think nec low emissions only one
 two types theres vlf very low frequency elf i think thats
extremely low frequency mprii standards set strict limits both
 many comapnies nec included according one article i read i get 
bunch mags so its hard me remember which which claim low
emissions specifically mprii compliant mprii certified
only control one usually vlf ignore other
so nec probably has higher overall image quality i consis
tently hear rated best close best low
emissions hitachi i like my image quality all i know you
may more discerning good luck
