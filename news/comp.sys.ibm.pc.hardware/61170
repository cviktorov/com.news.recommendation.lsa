i have internal modem i configure com irq 
when i insert card my dos pc shows up
 com irq coms address e

when i get debug dump data shows
 address e belonging com even though modem
should com


 common misconception shared my many manufacturers programmers
 users alike com example simply third equipped comm
port necessarily one io address e bios just
searches sequentially through set potential comm port addresses 
first equipped port finds become com etc youre playing 
 rules you cant have com unless you have com equipped set
 standard whatever means port addresses merely reflects 
order which bios searches io address space its search 
serial ports

so what you have indeed com nonstandard address e were
 address th table slot instead programs which query bios
 determine number installed comm ports would find 
field bios data area which contains number would indicate 
 comm ports installed frankly i dont know simgle
program would actually have problem
