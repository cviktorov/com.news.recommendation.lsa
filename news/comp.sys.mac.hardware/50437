 sony cpd has better video circuitry than either 
 other two monitors can display apple x vga x vga
 x though has hz flicker apple x hz
 refresh flicker all might able display apples
 x im sure about pixels would real
 small anyway so might useful

 note either sony monitor you need proper adapter
 which both connects video signals properly also informs 
 macintosh video hardware which display mode use

im assuming cabling tells mac startup what kind 
monitor connected now i think ive seen ads popular mac
magazines products im sure its just monitor just 
video card package both allow you change resolutions
 fly wo restarting mac

 you were buy would possible switch back 
forth between apple x apple x without restarting 
mac strictly hardware startup function can software
intervene does mac hardware occasionally probe cable
setting switch automatically

thanks
