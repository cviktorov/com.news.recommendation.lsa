funny how iisi running mhz slower than other equivalent
machines lots slower fact perhaps version mathematica
makes difference fact much ram allocated
another interesting thing how fast sgi did wow 

basically though i wouldnt draw any conclusions from data 
seems mathematicas speed dependant lot variables i
 just curious how different machines would measure up 

well you have any questions i forgot something just drop me
