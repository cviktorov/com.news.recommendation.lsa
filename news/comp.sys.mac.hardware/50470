another thing why scsi interface mds

 giving mo floppy interface could reduce price 
make easily installed existing devices

 question me like asking why use scsi all

 due rather primitive standard dma solution which used almost all
 floppy interfaces pcs speed limited approx kbytess 
 i want standard allowing higher performance

 scsi os can issue request disk go ahead other
 things later when controller has performed search physical read
 data can transferred main memory ram speeds very relevant 
 msdos msdos made future

 ive got scsi interface ive got floppy too i am
 going throw them out scsi i may add all practical purposes
 unlimited number disk units without sacrificing any my old disks 

 my pc ive got mbyte scsi disk adopted from sun machine i
 can carry over mac sparcstation alpha machine whatever i like
 i decide turn my back pc i do know i cannot expect
 move data without reformatting

 probably numerous other reasons scsi well

after all floppy replacement we taking about mb isnt all 
much so isnt going replace need fast fixed disk

 replace supplement contrary floppy md may fast enough
 run programs access data directly off md so well have much higher
expectationsdemands which much better supported scsi than old floppy
interface price scsi controllers high any more isnt 
something like dozen large pizzas nowadays
