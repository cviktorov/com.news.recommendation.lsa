 aside brian hughess please lets lose cute phony names
everybody posting about adding memory quadra 

 what phony names my name clearly visible headers i
sing post my account name you have problem 
 you have get over ive used account name over
 years people who have been reading newsgroups last 
generally recognize hades my account name i have intention 
changing way i post

i installed couple mb simms my quadra somewhat dismayed
 general complexity operation compared example 
wonderfully designed lc iii irritates me when apple refuses tell how
 do users manual so you have guess how disassemble
 devise question its same adding memory laserwriter
pros

 isnt apples responsibility tell its customers how fool
around its hardware what apple service techs get paid 
do i personally like design q applaud apple 
coming up good way make use front space all 
those drive bays i like lot better than design except
 those people who need drive arrays i do however agree you
about lw pro design

 operation isnt very complicated even minimal amount help were
offered apple leaves you working blind

 again itss apples place make easy noncertified
service people fool around apple hardware even did buy
 course you free do what you want your mac just dont
get upset when your apple service rep tells you your warranty 
longer valid

after memory installed i distraught top simms
came contact plastic case frame mine actually contacted 
framework quite lot pressure enough so assembly 
 board back proper position rather difficult required
some force i could have filed little excess material off top 
simm boards chose let stand i have had problems 
ram yet so i consider problem annoying catastrophic

 sounds like kind problem i had when i installed mb
simms lc back before lowprofile mb simms were readily
available standard mb simms would contact top case 
make bit difficult close lc did close work just
fine one nice things about logicboards 
generally quite flexible can withstand fair amount pressure
