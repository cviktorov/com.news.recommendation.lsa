whether drive hooked up computer lps
makes disk seek noise every seconds consistent 
 continue lomg drive powered up even 
i disconnect drive from computer drive activity
continues second intervals

someone tried tell me drive doing thermal recalibration

 knowing beans about internal physical workings lastest
disk drive technology i guess i might believe anything

whats scoop standalone drive activity every sec

i can only comment thermal recalibration general some new
drives perform order increase overall integrity data
writes basically firmware instructs actuator perform
 test see data tracks within certain physical
tolerance since when media heats up cools down some
track drift inevitable drive has monitor 
becomes especially critical very high recording densities 
so used primarily very largecapacity mechanisms 
seems finding its way more smaller drives way 
boosting drives longterm reliability mtbf ratings

i first became aware thermal recalibration when pointed
out technique conflicts prolonged write times when
digitizing say audio video hard disk some manufacturers
explicitly state drives thermal recalibration 
 used applications have prolonged disk writes

hope helps
