 mb qunatum hd
can i us pin cable connectors internal motherboard
scsiconnector scsihd connectors first hd isnt
terminated
 second 
whats about power supply where can i connect ampconnector
 supply my hd

 very possible connect another internal hard disk any
macintosh you can find space put i have iisi came
 quantum meg drive when i ran space problems i slapped 
another meg quantum i had sitting shelf here what i did
 
first off i concerned about space since both drives quantum
quarter height drives i finally decided logical place them
 stacked one upon other fine fit snugly i have had 
problem heat yet drives have been running together 
over two months

 next problem connecting drive you have spare internal
hard disk power cable i did half your troubles over just
splice extra cable so you get one square motherboard
connector two hard disk power connectors you dont have spare
cable you have buy wires connectors which can found
 any good electronics store about i would suggest properly
solderingheatshrinking connections reduce possibility 
shorts bad connections

next you need ribbon cable connection again i had spare hard disk
ribbon cable i wanted careful case didnt word so what
i did purchase crimp pin cable connector gave me another
male connector middle my spare cable part cost again
 easily attached any good wood vice theory behind using 
crimp connector doesnt work my original cable 
damaged i can go back original setup

having done all i couldnt bothered check dev notes 
power consumption so i plugged works like charm 
day 

 mac ii everything should work same careful ids 
 drive ensure terminating resistors both drives 
intact i did try without terminating resistors 
seemed logical i am splitting scsi chain signal
should terminated all ends

let me know you have any more questions
