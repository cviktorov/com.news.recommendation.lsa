i want achieve overall throughput rate around megabytes sec
 very large data transfers around mb

i have quadra 
i have nubus network card can pump data mac memory mbs
 using blockmode transfers
i have highspeed disk array asynchronous pb calls can
 achieve mbs

lets say all transfers go from disk buffer network card

 enough first transfer all data from disk buffer
 transfer all data from buffer card mbs mbs
result overall mbs too slow

so i tried following scheme nmegabyte transfer 

step load st mb from disk buffer
step asynch send st mb out card load nd mb from disk buffer
step asynch send nd mb out card load rd mb from disk buffer
 
step n asynch send n mb out card load nth mb from disk buffer
step n send nth mb out card

even though code apparently does execute card transfer asynchronously
 card does use mac cpu all using buffer tho
each steps through n take long two transfers were
executed one after another so improvement rate

why

 mac ram dualport so nubus card disk driver can both
access data same time
 problem two devices card disk driver both have use
 same bus mac ram

 anything i can do
