why would apple release duo dock processor its own

heres why people have hounded apple notebook processor
 apple cant deliver right now because saps too much
power radiates far too much heat too large notebook how
does one get around without designing new chipset use existing
powerbook technology your best advantage duo dock gives apple 
unique ability give users power semiportable fashion
 plunking dock youve got quadra power your desk
 road mhz should able handle most your needs
okay best solution its answer nowin situation 
so does mean one able use powerbooks processor 
parallel docks processor okay were getting really hypothetical
now 

 would also great another reason when docked could serve
 ara server large internal hd your corporate email etc 
 pinch you would also have two machines instead 

 could couple thought rocketshare let you use both 
 pb dock would mighty powerful dock
