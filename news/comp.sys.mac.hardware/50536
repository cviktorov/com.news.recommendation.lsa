 i thought nec toshiba cdrom mechanism have average
access time less than ms while sonyapple cdrom
drive has access time ms doublespin models

 chung yang

 toshiba has ms access time nec has ms access
time right around sonyapple access time course
somewhat important vital case cds data
transfer rate

all drives doublespeed drives maximum data transfer
rates ksecond any good choice apples very cheap
when included new macs i agree christians comment
about drivers

plus apples bootable centris quadra very nice
feature you need install system software i dont know 
nec toshiba bootable those machines
