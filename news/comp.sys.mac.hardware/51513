yes you get internal mixing analog cdaudio outputs 
 mac generated audio mac motherboard also you can sample
 cdaudio using sound control panel clicking options
button next microphone icon

 whats my iivx internal cd doesnt have any cdaudio
 icon

i cant find any option my centris either other hand i
dont see why i need one i try recording sound builtin
microphone audio cd playing drive i get cd audio mixed
 microphone sound

 i guess i unplug microphone ill get uncontaminated cd
audio admittedly sampled bits through dad conversion

sorry about misinformation i made bad assumption about
 new machines behaving like quadra see previous
post about sampling cd audio though have you tried i 
found aliasing really bad like needed filter something
much worse than i expected i installed cd 
quadra myself so maybe i missed something everything else
works great though
