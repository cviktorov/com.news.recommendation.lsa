yea thanks lots good information newsgroup i prepared
 lots details even shipping time got my c cd weeks
i guess my biggest disappointment lack detail written
specs documentation case load spec example setup
section says apple monitors can go top other
big ones cant why couldnt publish maximum load

now i can figure out theres any hope using partition button
 hard disk setup utility do i dare just try see what happens
 maybe i can divide up wealth among family members bit more
securly getting more information section manual suggested
trying other avenues before calling apple didnt mention net
