ben

since youre obviously adept enough understand how trackball works
 only thing short repairing i can think thorough
cleaning all parts checking proper placement 
 little blue rollers since arent fixed position 
stainless steel pins you might try sliding them slightly different
position my powerbook i can slide them almost completely out 
contact trackball fact one notes from sumex fixing
 trackball advocates sliding roller so its edge contacts 
ball center cylindrical area

ive done my pb does seem improve feel 
needs adjusted from time time i just popped open one our
offices pbs while isnt much latitude movement one
could still adjust roller slightly your pb same might
help

i would suspect most likely culprit slippery blue roller 
you can take out clean mild soapy solution isopropyl 
alcohol also sure ball greasefree

 you drop ball minus retaining ring roll ball see
 actually causing axle spin 

 all still doesnt solve maybe new one order 
 could electrical connection which case replacement would 
necessary my experience both mice trackballs has been 
dirt has been normal problem electrical malfunction

hope helps
