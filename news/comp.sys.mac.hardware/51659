i am having trouble scsi mac iifx machine years old
 i have been using same hard drive internal maxtor lxts 
two half years disk recently crashed i reformatted silverlining
 during reformat i received random write errors during testing
 error message reported like

sector write error detected after testing good sector mapped out

 occurred randomly all over hard disk which makes me suspect 
diagnostics reference sector third reformat after
reinstalling scsi readwrite loops i able get through passes
 errors pass some reason reported lot errors
 still mapped out sectors i decided go ahead try resinstall
system reload my data from backup proceded normally however
i now have suboptimal performance symptoms include

 o frequent crashes
 o instances extremely sluggish disk access requiring reboot 
 correct
 o instances finding disk scsi chain reboot
 i boot from norton utl after occurs cannot find 
 disk either
 only thing fixes recycling power sometimes
 requires several attempts

questions

 has anyone had type problem before
 problem fx motherboard its nonstandard
 scsi implementation my maxtor disk some
 diagnostic software would help me make determination
 termination problem i currently have external syquest
 external dataframe xp chain xp 
 end has internal termination so i am using iifx
 terminator i do have scsi filter installed internal
 drive i have run exact steup years 
 one previous disk crash requiring reformat about year ago
 i also have symptoms i disconnect external devices
 so i dont see how scsi termination would now issue 
 course who knows 

help would much appreciated
