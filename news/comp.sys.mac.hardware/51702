 my friend recently purchased lc iii he wants know 
 demon called nubus adapter his pds slot 

 lc family macs can only
 use pds cards able use nubus

 ah why can some technicallyhip macslinger tell us what 
 difference between pds nubus 

 impossible make gadget plugs pds ends 
 nubus card cage least marvins friend has been able 
 locate one neither have i what fundamental reason 
 

i think do exist nubus expansion cages im sure ive seen
them advertised occassionally i think main problem 
 cost much more than difference price between say lc iivx
so unless you need lots nubus slots its worth bother

 course may extra boxes so expensive because
 one buys them because so expensive

nubus technology isnt special apple proprietry thing i have 
sneaky feeling licensed from texas instruments so 
 problem building expansion box

 difference between nubus pds nubus clever interface
 lots neat toys built make sure lots cards can work
together same computer pds processor direct slot just 
here all connections processor you can do anything 
 quick can theres cooperation you
may able get double pds slot adaptors you try plugging 
video cards just watch them conflict course extra 
electronics nubus slot makes appreciably more expensive so
guess why apple doesnt put its cheaper machines

so yah pays yer money yah takes yah choice
