 my pli m syquest drive has wire from 
 drive id switch outside case where do i connect
 switch can computer just tell internal drives

you probably want hardwire scsi id shorting jumpers put
 convenient number like you could cut hole 
back machine route id switch why go through 
hassle you probably wont needing frequently change id 
your internal drive

i noticed drive lay over part motherboard i
didnt look closely i seem recall laying over ram thats
soldered onto motherboard would cause problems

yeah when i first installed tape drive i little concerned
too its problem device designed fit just fine
 overhang shouldnt reach back beyond romramvram
simms though

one last question anywhere order faceplate cover 
 drives front panel smaller than space left case 
drives panel same size spotsbm clones cases should i just
cut hole plastic panel currently holding tmpty place

you can specialorder parts mount device from your local apple
dealer relevant parts 

 blank bezel faceplate
 cdrom carrier ie generic device mounting bracket

note apples unfortunate choice name slidein bracket 
mount device service techs i talked said oh sure
we stock those course were thinking cd caddies 
hold cd disk when you stick drive

 far i can tell apple does sell bezel faceplate already
cut out standard device why advertise
 machines being able accept any standard device 
 bay why provide faceplate do sell cutout 
 cdrom drive course thats use

im going hack up extra bezel i ordered make cutout my
tape drive which standard device

good luck your syquest
