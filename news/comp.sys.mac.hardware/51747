following from st th
 
 
 

 

how about some numbers here some kind benchmark
 you want let me start dx specint specfp 

while youre where following fit list
 
 pentium
 powerpc

 fastest pentium first versions powerpc
somewhere vicinity

numbers pentium mhz specint specfp 
 powerpc mhz specint specfp note 
 alpha mhz specint specfp just comparison

 about clock speed does doubling clock speed double 
overall processor speed fill s below
 mhz mhz

 computer speed only partly dependent processorclock speed
memory system speed play large role does video system speed 
io speed processor clock rates go up speed memory
system becomes greatest factor overall system speed 
you have mhz processor can reading another word from memory
every ns sure you can put all ns memory your computer 
 cost times much slower ns simms

 clockdoubled system isnt doubling performance 
 quite significant maybe about increase performance

besides wait state performance youd need cache anyway i mean
who uses processor runs speed ns simms note 
memory speed corresponds clock speed mhz

 roughly twice fast given clock
speed 

numbers
