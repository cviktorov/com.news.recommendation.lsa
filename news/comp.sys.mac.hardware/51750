 i just got duo im having some difficulties
 machine plugged wall adapter put sleep
unplugged from wall woken up crashes time
theres nothing original system software machine
 battery has plenty life i think must power manager
problem i dont know what do about 
also speaker occasionally makes highpitched hiss noise
 irregular seems favor sleep restart commands

ive had my duo few weeks now suffer from both
 above problems i reinstalled my system software twice
 effort combat problems thinking were
system software problems initially reinstalling system
seemed help anymore occasionally when i try 
wake up duo i get solid screen horizontal lines 
 screen freezes

i also get highpitched hiss occasionally only 
startup

ive called apple hotline sosappl three times
already finally agreed something astray after my
duos screen would go dim hard drive spun down 
itselft put itself sleep problem only occured
twice apple sent me box ship my duo looked 
new york problem now intermittent i cant
afford without my duo time

yes quite number people seems from discussions ive had me
included i bought my machine couple weeks ago well 
started experience problems

apple australia via my dealer said problem has number 
potential causes faulty applications faulty third party hardware
modems memory etc system software pram corruption power
manager corruption duo hardware itself

none above relevant my case except last two maybe
 applications were running system software reinstalled i
have additional hardware i have found clearing pram appears
 help while least hold down command option p r 
startup unfortunately problem returns suggesting pram 
being corrupted something system software bug i dont have any
nonissue inits my system apparently power manager can 
reset holding reset interrupt buttons while powering up 
apples advice since duo does have interrupt button
im sure what mean case may also help 
someone can decipher apples advice me

beyond apple suggest you should follow technical
procedures check hardware duo since so many others
appear having same problem would seem me 
has been system software bug introduced somewhere along line 
 quite recently too since only seems recent duo 
purchasers who have problem

any more comments from others same boat welcome
particularly apple duo engineers 

cheers
