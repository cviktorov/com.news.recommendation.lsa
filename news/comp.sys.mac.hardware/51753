first all thank you everyone who replied you can well
imagine i got nearly one hundred responses so i figured id thank
you all here instead individually

 tallies

i got one vote aux which runs macintosh

i got several nays commodores ux system

most people agreed sgis were nice very very expensive

some devoted sun users nearly insisted i try find used
sun say 

about dozen people told me how love nextonly now next
 out hardware business see below

 most other people said get box run some
version unix thats available either public domain 
commercially



 so i weighed my options what stood out my opinion 
 were several different versions unix available one system
 pc architecture i bought sun id have use sunos
 i bought used next id have use nextstep see below ad
nauseum

 pc i can run linux which small userfriendly 
flavor uses shared libraries cut down volume although i
hear its networking abilities arent up speed bsd another
pd free port which takes up lot more space i can purchase
bsd commercial product i choose several other
commercial packages available

so what ive found out after pricing systems etc i can
get really good unix workstation little including
source code

 i can get unbelievable eisa bus dx
system fully blown run single user bsd

what im really excited about though nextstep intel next
changed software company only releasing os
 pcs ive used nexts before i absolutely loved them
everyone who wrote me about next nextstep commented 
developers environment how well designed whole package 



so my choice 

 wait mail monday so i can read what nextsteps system
requirements 

 im wowed what say ill buy system fits 
 criteria

 get nextstep

 im wowed i cant afford yet most likely ill buy 
system fits criteria

 get linux bsd temporary learning experience so i
can save up nextstep

 im sufficiently wowed least likely ill buy system
 slightly less blown out like dx isa put linux
 bsd 



again thanks everyone around net
