i just hooked up my mac iisi relatively old year asante ensc
adapter baset connection works like charm i installed 
newest drivers from asantes ftp server

 problem begins when i attach one more device scsi chain 
specifically mb drive i power up drive mac mac
tests memory etc just before happy mac face normally shows up 
power light ensc goes out boot process stops so i can use
 network external drive both once makes 
asante box pretty much unusable

 doesnt look like purely electrical scsi problem because i turn
 drive just second so too late so doesnt get noticed
during initial scsi polling mac boots normally adapter
works even though hard disk powered connected mac has
never once failed boot from its internal drive up now ive had
 over year

here what i tried changing scsi ids ensc disk 
several permutations changing order devices ie ensc 
head tail chain overterminating external terminator
both devices have internal ones underterminating ie removing internal
resistors from hard disk trying another ensc box trying another
identical drive trying several different scsi cables

has anybody seen more importantly does anyone have solution
thanks lot e
