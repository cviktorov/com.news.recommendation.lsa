hi 

does anyone know why apple has ambiguous message 
c regarding fpu all mac price lists ive seen every c
has message fpu optional i know from what weve discussed 
newsgroup all c have fpu built except 
configuration why would so unclear about issue 
price list
im planning buy c cd pretty soon im now getting
confused whether comes fpu 
why say optional its built 
please anybody help me understand game

regards

thian

 you get centris cd configuration you getting mac 
 rc processor has builtin math coprocessor support my 
understanding optional fpu refers your option purchasing
 centris without fpu one other configurations fpu

apple does offer upgrade from nonfpu system become fpu
system unclear whether processor nonfpu system
 lc can replaced rc supplied another vendor
apple did send memo out one point sating centris which only
comes nonfpu lc processor cannot upgraded support fpu 
 pin configurations two chips apparently do match so you cannot
swap one another again according apples memo

hope helps
