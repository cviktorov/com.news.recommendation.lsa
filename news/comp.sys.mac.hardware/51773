hi i think i have problem stereo sound output my quadra
 i am totally sure because my roomate has same problem
 his powerbook any info experience anyopne has would 
greatly appreciated

when i hook my quadra up my home stereo system following types
 sounds mono far i can tell all play fine through both
speakers

system beeps already provided ones indigo ones i record

armor alley
spectre
spaceward ho


 following games only play out left channel

lemmings
out world awesome game btw
glider 
oids


 still stereo system beeps do play stereo through both speakers
 one im specifically referrring apocolyptic beginning which
my roommate downloaded from some ftp site sumex


all symptoms same my rommates he cant run
ootw because he doesnt have color

were both running system 



does anyone lemmings other three games i mentioned above get
sound out both speakers mac ii class quadra lc powerbook 
greater centris se etc stereo machine

i used have mac ii i sort rememeber lemmings playing 
stereo machine just left channel i could 
mistaken though were problem quad s pb
s i am wondering why system beeps still play stereo 
isnt problem our machines i wonder why games above 
apparantly written support only one channel stereo when 
could just use mono sounds so mono sound would least come out 
both speakers like spectre etc do

quadra s powerbook s have same roms my knowledge
so maybe rom problem so though why wouldnt system 
patch over problem




thanks any help you can provide
