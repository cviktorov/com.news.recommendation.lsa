 friend asked me build cable connect hp fetal heart monitor
 maciontosh se problem sez i


i wanted demo my pb wont work

 pb has been used running zterm kermit using both internal external
modems so i dont think its powerbook per se

when i send hp responds aa test serial
ports works se pb

i thought se connected earth ground so hp so i
connected from chassis hp pw audio ground connector still
ng

any thoughts

battery powered devices like powerbook sometimes more sensitive 
serial port weirdness i had trouble connecting my mac plus hp lx
handheld everything else worked okay port hp runs
 two penlite batteries turned out plus accident 
design flaw putting volt bias serial port doing 
weird things hp which has only v dc hp worked fine when 
connected printer port 

does your pb screen get dim anything when connected device have you 
tried using printer port

good luck
