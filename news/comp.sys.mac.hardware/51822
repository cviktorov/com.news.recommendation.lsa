does anyone know why apple has ambiguous message c regarding
fpu all mac price lists ive seen every c has message fpu
optional i know from what weve discussed newsgroup all
c have fpu built except configuration why would
 so unclear about issue price list

 i think mostly fault people who write up 
literature price lists being confused themselves since 
two possible processor configurations one them doesnt have
 fpu does seem option even though really isnt

im planning buy c cd pretty soon im now getting
confused whether comes fpu 

 well allow me end your confusion c only come 
 lc base configuration you getting 
configuration you getting fpu

why say optional its built 

 good question i have been wondering since feb th

 you get centris cd configuration you getting mac 
 rc processor has builtin math coprocessor support my 
understanding optional fpu refers your option purchasing
 centris without fpu one other configurations fpu
 
 possible option something you supposed
 able request when you want what apple has done given 
buyer choice between configurations option

apple does offer upgrade from nonfpu system become fpu
system unclear whether processor nonfpu system
 lc can replaced rc supplied another vendor

 unclear all fact apple has included roms
 those machines lcs code recognize presence full
s fpu use thereby making upgrade easy switching
chips you pop lc out pop full 

apple did send memo out one point sating centris which only
comes nonfpu lc processor cannot upgraded support fpu 
 pin configurations two chips apparently do match so you cannot
swap one another again according apples memo

 did i think i would doublecheck has been stated
countless times newsgroup two centris hardware
designers lc full pin compatible 
 c can upgraded full
