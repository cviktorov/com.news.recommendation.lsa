 follows

eight mb ram
ethernet
 mb vram
math coprocessor option

my purchasing agent told me about math coprocessor option sent
me apple summary documentation prove i ordered coprocessor
option im really sure we needed i thought chip
had math coprocessor built has apple had math coprocessor chip
architectured keep up speed chip centris 
i am concerned i may have set up hardware bottleneck

 apple has really confused people whole thing i think
well answering question about next year so 
 option get fpu c what you have choice cpus
 lc does have integrated fpu like full
 only present base model c appleusa
 full which you get when you order anything other
than base configuration therefore since you have ordered one
 mb versions onboard ethernet models you 
getting lc even you wanted have lc you wouldnt
 able order c mb ram onboard ethernet lc
its option
 also note people out have cs cs
thinking optional fpu class chip cannot
recognize external fpu so socket motherboard 
 fpu chip you cannot go out purchase fpu pds card 
something like only way get fpu machines 
replace lc full you have c you 
need worry about heat sink you do replace lc 
full you have c you do need have heat sink
