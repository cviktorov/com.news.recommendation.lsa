hi i think i have problem stereo sound output my quadra
 i am totally sure because my roomate has same problem
 his powerbook any info experience anyopne has would 
greatly appreciated

when i hook my quadra up my home stereo system following types
 sounds mono far i can tell all play fine through both
speakers

system beeps already provided ones indigo ones i record

armor alley
spectre
spaceward ho


 following games only play out left channel

lemmings
out world awesome game btw
glider 
oids


 still stereo system beeps do play stereo through both speakers
 one im specifically referrring apocolyptic beginning which
my roommate downloaded from some ftp site sumex


all symptoms same my rommates he cant run
ootw because he doesnt have color

were both running system 



does anyone lemmings other three games i mentioned above get
sound out both speakers mac ii class quadra lc powerbook 

greater centris se etc stereo machine

i used have mac ii i sort rememeber lemmings playing 
stereo machine just left channel i could 
mistaken though were problem quad s pb
s i am wondering why system beeps still play stereo 

isnt problem our machines i wonder why games above 
apparantly written support only one channel stereo when 
could just use mono sounds so mono sound would least come out 
both speakers like spectre etc do

quadra s powerbook s have same roms my knowledge
so maybe rom problem so though why wouldnt system 
patch over problem




thanks any help you can provide

mac sound hardware diverse some macs play stereo 
mix output se instance while others play 
stereo only has left channel speaker while
some truly mono like lc

developers know stuff played left channel 
guaranteed heard while right channel isnt some
send data both some only send data left channel
 first preferrable course

okay i guess its time quick explanation mac sound

 original documentation sound hardware im documents how 
make sound directly accessing hardware basically you jam values
 all even bytes from soundbase soundbasex 
because
 how mac some later machines generated sound 
scanning
 block daing every even byte odd bytes went floppy 
some machines

when mac ii apple sound chip invented designed 
generate stereo sound also designed compatible we had
once
documented so storing bytes even values soundbase meant i
want 
play mono sound so emulated apple had since retracted

documentation soundbase decided document lowest layers

sound generation so apple never explained where stuff bytes you
want
 make stereo sound

enter game developers sound driver current sound manager 
inconveniently lame making games furthermore people who port from

ibm dont want learn more apis so has become popular game
writers write soundbase make sound since very easy

since mac ii apple has had many different kind sound output
hardware
 only things have common writing soundbase
works
 some hardware mac ii iix iicx iici least writing soundbase
gets you mono sound through both speakers some macs quadra

 least writing soundbase gets you mono sound left channel
only
both technically correct interpretations original
specification
 one obviously preferable asthetic reasons

 developers use sound manager i think sound driver mono
sounds typically come out through both channels regardless 
underlying hardware possible specify you want generate left
channel only one does developers write sound base 
games only come out left some games

 other problem original mac ii only producing left channel sound
 internal speaker while se mixes both isnt really related
 due post generation amplification used motherboards 
 different machines only affects true stereo sounds sounds which
 actually mono play internal speaker matter what
machine
you have

now more directly address question games you list
lemmings
out world awesome game btw
glider 
oids
 also
hellcats
super tetris
oxyd
 many more just what ive tested

cheat write soundbase so only left channel quadras


other games you list
armor alley
spectre
spaceward ho
 also
pga tour golf
civilization
 more again only from personal experience

use sound manager work fine all machines

 more story developers dont cheat
really i am absolutely positively allowed do what i am about 
do
 im going say anyway
stop cheating sound
really soon you sorry even those without external speakers
 disappointed your sound future hardware grace period
 about end
 sound manager understandable now works pretty well 
work
even better soon so use 

 conclusion
 doug isnt hardware problem least bug
 jon isnt choice developers whether want send
sound
 both channels do right way taken care 
automatically you cheat way make work all
hardware


have fun

disclaimer number 
i dont work sound here apple im just pretty well informed
so dont write me sound questions

disclaimer number 
 says up above i wrote anything like grace period about
 end bug your news feed since i am catagorically 
allowed say anything like you know what i mean

disclaimer number 
i dont speak apple just me
