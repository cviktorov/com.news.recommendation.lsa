 anyway i hoping someone knowledgeable
 about mac internals could set me straight simply
 impossible mac se print grayscale could
 
 use grayscale features i believe you need mac equipped
 colour quickdraw i told somewhere other its
 
 i think you find mac se can print grayscale images loaded
 proper software however mac se cannot display grayscale 

 original poster w g wright posted item saying he had bought new
wizzbang laser printer from apple select i think which can print
grayscale he said he cannot print grayscale from his se computer
 also all experts he has dealt agree 
possible

 one major bugbear about doing rd party se upgrade compared 
apples se se upgrade you never able run color quickdraw 
 color quickdraw controls color grayscale

ses can print some colour because quickdraw original noncolour
version has right hooks eight colours some you remember 
scsigraph solution getting colour screen your se i think 
gave you sixteen colours dithering something

 reason apple couldnt release software patches older
computers lots mac pluses classics ses have been
upgraded processors which should perfectly able deal
 color quickdraw wont rd parties having difficult 
time duplicating macs roms ie nutek et al

just one caveat i would have thought you were printing postscript
grayscale image onto postscript grayscale printer you would able 
do so whatever mac you were using i am pretty sure select 
 postscript printer correct me im wrong
