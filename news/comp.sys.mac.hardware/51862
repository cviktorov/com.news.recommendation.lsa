just quick summary recent findings re high speed modems top three
contenders seem att paradyne zyxel us robotics zyxel has 
biggest cult following can had under i ignored 
because i need something mac software which work without any
tweaking

 att dataport earns nearly unanimous praises reliability 
backordered moment probably because special price 
effect until may its fax capabilities worse than other two
modems warning att ads say modem comes mac kit cables 
all has lifetime warranty applies only when you order
directly from paradyne i called elektek one distributors 
 wanted charge me cable gave only year warranty

usr sportster mac also highly highly recommended
its only from clubmac you willing roll your own cable
 dont care about faxstf software you can get generic model
from pc outlets 

all assuming you dont have rich uncle cant afford 
motorola codex i ended up ordering dataport well see how
 works two weeks so
