i remember someone mention about meg syquest has anyone else
heard anything about id interested cost per megabyte 
approximate cost drive itself how compare bernoulli 

i think you must talking about syquest code named mesa i believe
 winchester technology drive pretty much like other syquest
drives terms how works according latest macleak 
drive has ms access time mbs sustained throughput figures
 from memory so could slightly off give you idea 
performance nonetheless drive originally released pc
 just recently released mac world dont ask me what 
differences through currently limited supply according
 syquest rep process ramping up mass production
i have already seen them advertised number manufacturers macleak
including pli massmicro clubmac macwarehouses poweruser pli
 massmicro units priced just around lesser name brands
 going around external drive cartridges which hold 
 mb sell about each prices drives cartridges
 cheaper better performing than mb drives
cost per megabyte compares favorably other cartridge drives bernoulli
drives large amounts data optical still cheaper more
reliable personally im excited new drive look forward 
getting my hands one
