send follow ups compsysmacadvocacy sorry about header 
pnews here does let one easily change headers i gave up after 
year trying sheet also available ftp sumexaimstanfordedu 
 infomacreport macibmcomparetxt
mac ibm infoversion 

 reason general data sheet consolidate condense 
information out so people both camps can clear accurate 
about what saying about machines since computer technology 
 always changing always going points which sheet 
 lacking incorrect information so please just dont say sheet 
 incomplete incorrect also give me clear concise information 
make needed corrections all prices us dollars
 keep data sheet organized please provide possible article 
citations information provided corrected keep opinions 
 minimum general data sheet keep info provided simple so 
i can understand what being talked about can explain others 
finally keep information relevant section corrected example 
os code rom software contained hardware so more 
 supported os disk software data hardware section please 
thank you

scsi devices per scsi controller bit asynchronous mbs ave
