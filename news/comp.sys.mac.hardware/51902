 i have tried almost everything under sun get null modem connection
 between mac duo pc i have used mackermit versaterm 
 mac side i have used procomm kermit softerm os 
 pc ps side i have used nonhardware handshaking hardware
 ahdshaking cables know my hands shaking from effort nothing
 has allowed file transfers from mac ps



 could i hear from someone attesting can really pump information
 out serial port duo fast like via modem via 
 sysex dump
 
 could anyone duo help me out i am going absolutely insane
 i wanna know problem my duo all duo s all duos
 just me
 


hmmm sounds vaguely similar problem i had long time ago when i 
trying use kermit i building serial connection between my duo 
 my next i think problem handshaking basically you need 
 make sure handshaking protocol same both sides safe 
place start selecting handshaking either end one problem 
 zilog serial chip seems get permanently wedged you talk 
wrong only reset clear i dont know specifics 
could nonlinearity screws up your attempts debugging system 
 could very well you doing things righteventually one 
wrong move like trying bad handshaking protocol can screw up any further 
correct actions until next machine reset i have wedged my mac also 
my next way

now i can send files back forth between duo next without any 
problem pretty high speeds too

i dont know what kind chip pc uses i think zilog 
pretty standard

hope helps
