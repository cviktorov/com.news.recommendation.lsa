attention mac quadra owners many storage industry experts have
 concluded mac quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
 from standard scsi specification results silent corruption
 data when used some devices including ultramodern devices
 although i name devices since fault 
 example would sony inch mo without special maccompatible
 firmware installed one solution sometimes disable blind writes
 
 best my knowledge arent any problems quadras 
blind transfers trouble blind transfers usually means programmer
screwed up tibs didnt test driver device question
well designed tibs poll loop every point where delays sec occur
 usually occurs first byte each block transfer some
devices can hiccup middle blocks happens middle
 blind transfer possibility losing gaining byte
depending which direction tranfer going anycase scsi manager
 eventually return phase error end transaction because
 out sync actual data loss would only occur driver didnt
pay attention errors coming back

note effect caused anything actually scsi bus 
rather transfer loops inside scsi manager problem occurs when
 processor bus errors trying access scsi chip when next byte
hasnt been clocked yet also note bus error dealt bus
error handler doesnt crash machine
