last weeks macweek article ric ford indicated david ramseys
mac iix has been running nicely mac iici rom offering
clean bit rom code liberating his iix from virtual memory
nightmare caused apples bit system enabler

 would make me bit suspect mr ramseys qualifications
 selfstyled expert fact when i read about anybody
using virtual memory regularly i kind wonder 

yes one can sometimes get away running newer rom 
correct size obviously older machine one should 
prepared problems running software checks machine 
type rather than rom trap availability draws incorrect 
conclusions when specialcasing especially timingdependent
 driverrelated stuff

 particular case i see reason go trouble 
 romswapping apple bit enabler has problems 
mode works just fine 

does anyone know source roms 

sure buy used iici motherboard call preowned electronics
shreve other parts dealers see back computer shopper
 one mac trades phone numbers ask price
 iici rom everything has price you happen find
somebody who salvaged iici dead motherboard you might
get decent price probably market used mother
boards well so might sell rom anyway

needless say im interested purchasing rom what would
 reasonably price offer

ask quote try offering less preowned 
shreve have been known dicker ads various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices 
same items phone quotes tend vary well

still im aware any technical reason upgrading 
 rom iix
