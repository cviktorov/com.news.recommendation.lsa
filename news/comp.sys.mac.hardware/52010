several weeks ago i described problem my apple highresolution
monitor promised summarize replies received email 
recapitulate occasionally every two three hours so my monitor
momentarily loses sync entire raster image bounces down about 
eighth inch so rights itself usually happens right
after i close large window highlight large area do something 
radically alters image screen sometimes though happens
 provocation whatsoever

i have received bewildering range replies one extreme 
 man clearly quite knowledgable about monitors who said 
problem monitors power supply simply couldnt always
keep up sudden changes raster image rapid change from
 largely light screen largely dark one overtaxed monitors
power supply fix available he said because nothing 
really wrong i guess he meant flaw so fundamental 
 had endured

 seemed quite persuasive i would have been tempted 
adopt attitude stoicism except reply from monitor
owner who discovered very problem documented 
apple service technical procedures volume under heading
jitter correction section describes fix involving replacement
 capacitor adjustment potentiometer failing 
 swap circuit board

i would grateful discussion among those who have had
experience sort thing
