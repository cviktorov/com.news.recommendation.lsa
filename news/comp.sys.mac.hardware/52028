enter game developers sound driver current sound manager 
inconveniently lame making games

 sound driver pretty ok since its fast sound manager used 
book useless disposing sound channels soon sound has
completed
 out question games smooth animation its too slow

why would you dispose channel you going play more
sounds soon you trying write game you shouldnt
 using sndplay instead make channel use buffercmds
 play sounds works great you can add callbacks 
 channel also let you know when channel getting
empty before gets empty


 sound driver so much snappier than sound manager unfortunately
system supports poorly making programs crash occasionally

 moral story developers dont cheat

well i want my code work old systems too i dont know about sys

 least bugs sound manager causes
channels hang error message happends when i keep 
channel open long periods necessary performance play many
sounds stopping sounds halfway callbacks seems reliable
 only way i can safely tell sound has stopped playing 
inspect private variables channel qhead i think 
only way i have found tell channel hung inspect 
undocumented flag modify 

callbacks very reliable i found them reliable even
under system i doing continuous background sound 
interrupting sound effects system imv
documentation

you probably were cancelling your callback commands out 
your channels course you didnt get called general 
you have problems sounds working when you play one per
channel close channel related
slowdown when you play more than one you dont
work you adding more than one synthesizer 
channel possibly same one multiple times might 
because you calling sndplay preexisting channel 
 sound resource which adds sampled sound synthesizer 
 channel first thing before plays most sampled sounds
have command start them you need resedit
 sound remove command when you create your
channel specify sampled sound synthesizer 
channels synth you can use asynch sndplays all you
want youll probably want switch buffercmds since you
 going have use snddocommand anyway add callbacks

now before you go ahead tell me i am full 
sound manager doesnt work games remember spectre uses
 works great spectre can spare cpu time you
can too

one little disclaimer some out who say 
sound manager iisi cant made work right im 
sure either way i know sure you can make your
sounds work correctly every other machine using 
sound manager
