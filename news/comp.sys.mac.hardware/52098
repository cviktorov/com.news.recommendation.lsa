poll conducted help users decide whether alter 
iisi clock oscillator i have attempted gather many case histories 
possible find some estimate success risk number replies
probably shows how rare modification give impression 
success rates may higher than previous estimate 
machines were able run mhz when add boards were present
 scientific survey best we have work 

thanks all who contributed poll 


issues

speed mhz mhz appears norm machines without
add cards all reported machines were able use
 mhz long add cards were present several apple
nubus cards were use machine nubus adapter
 able go faster than mhz one wasnt even able 
achieve mhz nubus adapter place

 speeds mhz startup sound distorted 
hi density floppy disk problems have been reported

note unless specifically listed below machines were 
tested higher speed clock failure hence
 mhz operational machines may well work 
higher speeds

damage one user reported pulling out plating one pad 
repaired machine operational one other
reported pulling pin out original clock oscillator
during desoldering one second hand report user
putting gash motherboard slipped soldering iron

 reports static discharge damage

 reports high speed operation causing damage

 again i also dont have any reports from users 
defective parachutes

add boards compatibility appears problem apple nubus
adapters several other add boards have been used 
success see case histories

heat sinks virtually all modified machines had heat sink installed
 were often style power transistor type some
used epoxy some used dab heat sink compound dab
 cyanoacrylate glue also use clamp 
bolt through hole motherboard
