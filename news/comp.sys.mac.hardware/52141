i wonder how hard would ie what would add cost
 design desktop machines power saver feature built which would
reduce power consumption automatically machine idle more than
some amount time

i believe apple sun number other desktop machine
manufacturers have agreed government incorporate
powersaving techniques also something governments 
other countries likely require future so expect see
 may include ability system fully power down
 monitor via controllable power outlet power back 
automatically sell screen saver software companies

goals idle power consumption have been set something like 
watts system including monitor dont quote me 


note many businesses savings substantial
especially you factor reduced load air conditioning systems
sun did study indicated simply powering off monitors 
 night would save company sun itself order m per
year putting other automatic powersaving features would
probably have greater than double value

given we seeing more more reason leave our work 
home computers getting faxes automatically getting email 
building power consumption control all machines has potential 
cut off national power consumption based data i heard

btw when encouraging employees power off monitors when leaving
work pointed out should only done monitors
 power switch front some indication 
monitors power switches rear designed tolerate
lots power cycling may only apply monitors we use 
might worth checking you happen have monitor switch
 back
