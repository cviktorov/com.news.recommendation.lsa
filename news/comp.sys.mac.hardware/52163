 its good idea have horizontally formatted hard disk 
 vertical position drive formatted horizontal position
 can 
 completely compensate gravitational pull vertical position 

i asked question while ago while contemplating placing my 
its side i received response from someone seagate sorry i 
trashed message stating most newer drives seagates 
least can very well compensate gravity means 
horizontally formatted drive can later placed vertically data 
integrity problems

so any problems putting drive formatted vertically 
its side horizontally

i got drive few years ago rubber feet side
etc have used like since obviously designed 
orientation however doesnt fit under any clever
places i can think place so i would really like lay 
flat put under low shelf

 probably newer drive only meg 
when i bought large drive average user
comparable buying meg drive today so my old meg
drive fragile new meg drive

just curious
