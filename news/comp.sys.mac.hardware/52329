 i understand i have correct adapter i can
use vga monitor my iisi
 those adapters working specific brands
 adapter nec sony working other brands
 i using vga monitor iisi month soon
 i dont have any clue what monitor 

heres story

 iisi cannot supply vga output however

 some vgatype monitors can adequately deal video signal
 mac uses drive apple inch high resolution color
displayie apples own x mode

so you wish hook one monitors up your iisi you
need adapter converts from mac db connector 
vgastyle high density db connector tells mac use
its own x mode vga x mode b vga monitor
 can deal higher bandwidth mac x mode over
 vga x mode which i stated above iisi cannot
produce

 far above concerned contact

 can probably get you right adapter remember you do 
want runofthemill mactovga adapter because try 
have your iisi produce vga mode which cannot computer
 just fail produce any video signal all instead you want
 adapter connects between macstyle vgastyle
connectors tells mac use apple x mode sorry
 poor terminology available describing distinction

 far b concerned make sure get monitor can deal
 horizontal bandwidth khz vertical retrace rate 
 hz specs apples x mode comparison
 vgastandard x mode uses khz horizontal bandwidth 
 hz vertical retrace rate

 monitor probably need have autosynching capability 
 apple mode youll using isnt one set standard modes
 pc compatible world

good luck
