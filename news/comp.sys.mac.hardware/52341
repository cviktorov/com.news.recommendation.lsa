 my friend recently purchased lc iii he wants know 
 demon called nubus adapter his pds slot 

 lc family macs can only
 use pds cards able use nubus

 ah why can some technicallyhip macslinger tell us what 
 difference between pds nubus 

 impossible make gadget plugs pds ends 
 nubus card cage least marvins friend has been able 
 locate one neither have i what fundamental reason 
 

i think do exist nubus expansion cages im sure ive seen
them advertised occassionally i think main problem 
 cost much more than difference price between say lc iivx
so unless you need lots nubus slots its worth bother

 course may extra boxes so expensive because
 one buys them because so expensive

nubus technology isnt special apple proprietry thing i have 
sneaky feeling licensed from texas instruments so 
 problem building expansion box

apple uses ieee nubus standard bit backplane bus
i got from technote i reada couple weeks ago

well almost nubus anyway comprehensive bus contention between processors
 supported current macintoshes could wrong

however i know fact from seeing cyclone data spec sheets myself
dont ask macintosh cyclone models provide full implementation 
nubus standard

very interesting possibilities indeed


other stuff deleted

hope helps
