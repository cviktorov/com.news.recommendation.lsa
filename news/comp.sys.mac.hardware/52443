 rep dealer actually its university order center so
 dont have any immediate financial interest told me 
 have been having lots problems centris 
he didnt go details mentioned problems 
floppy drive intermittent problems printing files
 sounded me like were having both hardware problems
 software compatibility problems machine

hes recommending centris anybody he says 
consider centris iivx why he would recommend 
iivx over lciii i dont know thats what he said

so what does net think did dealer just get one flaky
machine did apple send c out door too early
 your c working just great buggy too

sounds me like your dealer really wants get rid iivxs he has 
stock i can imaging getting hard sell given 
 c way faster comparable price
 lciii about same speed way cheaper
so your dealer may well trying hard he can convince people
 iivxs much better buy than c just so he can get rid all
his old stock

 disrespect dealers iivx intended
