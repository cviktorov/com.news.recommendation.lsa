has anyone had any experience geicos extended
warranty plan seems slightly less expensive than
 normal dealersponsored policy

 once againnever buy extended warrantiesthey complete 
total ripoff period you better off taking your money putting 
 
 bank using money repairs many extended warranties never
pay have copayments etc 



how many people actually put money bank keep 
sole use automotive repairmaybe people who have hard time saving
money dont want hassle worrying about paying everything 
extended warranty worth itfor some people worth itothers 
 some peace mind knowing you wont have too many unexpected expenses
 enoughif you drive lot your basic warranty can up little longer than
 yearhow many people can make car payments well large repairs

 may work some people
