does take any peculiar tools remove rear springs from ford
f truck x leaf springs front rear

so big socket air wrench floor jack 
hydrolic bottle jack can i do home 

i found i needed some smaller sockets undo shocks
 can wd helped

 sockets needed were metric exact fit i able use
some sae sockets rather close mm
 can fun having canadian ford 

im pictureing undo u bolts put bottle jack axle
 raise bedframe take stress off leaf spring undo
 end boltsbushings drop spring turn bottom leaf 
reconnect spring bolts

sounds about right

didnt have undo end boltsbushings just u bolts 
each side shock absorber jacking up frame some more
had put spare tire garage floor put wooden 
platform top get floor jack high enough 
raise frame one talll truck lifted spring
free axel taking out block gave me enough room 
undo pin holding spring pack together

 spring pack held together nut top round head
 other end wrench head vice grips worked fine
i soaked nut wd came right off

flipped bottom spring 

 nightmare waiting happen easy though physically
demanding thing do

well its easier than doing decent trigger job 
ok well maybe its easy its terribly
difficult

i donno im little more sore today than after working 
 

 foot pipe cheater real help torque spec u bolt
nuts ftlbs doesnt have kind 
torque spec 

 challenge get pack bolt back spring pack 
squeeze pack two hands hold bolt third put nut 
 fourth while picking up wrench vice grips fifth
 sixth hands i used some string tie pack together
while holding pin alignment i could let go
 get nut wrench vice grips

getting pin back lined up lift block challenge too
until i discovered axel had tilted andor rolled forward

one drivers side bottle jack under front differential
tilted back line enough pin head drop right
hole passenger side i had wrestle wheel rolling
forward about inch get things line up spent more than 
hour working getting pin head hole lift block
 levers ropes impliments distruction before i took 
break thought about why wasnt lined up anymore since had
been lined up before i didnt move something else must 
have hmmm axle longer constrained move hmmm move 
 back hmmm

after all much easier close up

btw ride now softer quite soft i hoping 
 least now sits level
