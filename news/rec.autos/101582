 silly thing about whole argument most trunk
releases im tempted say all theres bound 
counterexample only operate car acc running thus
you cant easily pop trunk without starting car

most cars only cars ive ever seen feature have been
gm cars my mazda honda coming soon probe all have
cableoperated releases my 
camaro had electric hatch release thankfully independent 
 key ignition exception rule mentioned my first
sentence

i should probably have said glovebox trunk releases i havent
encountered any glovebox releases cable operated numerous
gm several fordmercury cars ive encountered have electrical
releases glovebox all ones ive seen needed 
ignition some degree operate your camaro example noted
 since its hardtop its big deal ive never run 
convertible cableoperated trunk release id agree 
 environment cable alwaysactive electrical release
would rather stupid

my honda has cable release can locked out ignition key
 valet key can left someone unlock trunk
 enable cable release

i remember my mothers corvette had electronic hatch release
located drivers door which always active fact 
car had real trunk makes security measure beign able 
disable hatch release unnecessary
