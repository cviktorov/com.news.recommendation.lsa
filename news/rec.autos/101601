 you surprised number people who forget glasses
 while driving people who just plain dont get
 eyes checked once year

 someone who has lousy vision i can see objects distance without
my glasses however quite fuzzy i may able make
out details i can certainly tell something 


 i wont argue too much about anything i am probably one those 
think we cant have enough safety roads i would gladly 
sacrifice distractions you call than someone having trouble seeing
danger earlier one saved life justifies more than my lifetime distractions
 me


 dawn dusk when your eyes have yet adjusted
 poor light those who drive blackgrey cars 
 case where you driving down twoway one lane 
 road someone overtaking cars coming opposite direction 
 doesnt see you because your lights vice versa mph 
 quite small reaction time course we too macho 
 think we invincible can react faster than only poor 
 sod who you didnt see might have normal life ever

i worked out reaction time previous post its plenty even 
 year old grandma long speeds mph range less
 you some other driver going way faster than careful

 always you responsible your driving actions you pull out 
pass crash someone whatever reason its your fault you cant


 problem i may just kill guy i agree i would fault
 i have my license revoked why i might even go gas chamber
 fact still remains guy dead someone died because i
 too stingy put my lights 


see damn thing you shouldnt driving lights fail fallen trees
 rocks dont have lights etc i maintain headlight strength


 ratio probability fallen treesrocks roads 
oncoming traffic too low even considered difference also
working what we know could happen what might happen


running lights necessary motorists who drive around mph may
 good idea force running headlights when you turn your
windshield wipers only because some people too stupid do so
 you crash one those idiots you have fight out court 
show his neglegence you can even prove 


 just out curiosity how much gasmilage do you loose when you put
 your lights how much do you reduce life your headlamps
 what cost your headlamps anyway

mileage certainly reduced very very small amount probably
about watts head running lights extra horsepower
 must made engine may cost you around two 
gallons year times million cars thats lot gas

 compared number gallons gas consumed those million cars
 miniscule 

 whatever tis pity i have share same roads person
 concerned safety

lamp life measured hours so you normally drive half daylight 
half night your lamps have replaced twice often headlamps
only cost about us most halogen lamps

 cost individual trivial me issue what i
dont like distractions all cars headlights cause i dont
need constantly see headlights vehicle behind me i dont need
 see headlights every gosh darn car mile down road 
lit up cars make nonilluminated things less visible like pedistrians 
bikes hopefully were going mandate drls people bikes 
too

 stream taillights tolerable orange front running lights
 certainly sufficient other people see you look 
doesnt distract me nearly much full power headlights
