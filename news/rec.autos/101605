well difference

i dont happen have my sae manual handy oil viscosity general
decreases temperature sae numbers based typical
curve oils used all have running from say viscosity 
roomtemperature weight c down say roomtemperature 
weight c typical weight oil

oils designed operation normal temperatures just have
 weight specification oils designed operation exceedingly
cold temperatures have w tacked end so winter cold
place youd stick w your car winter summer
 approximate appropriate viscosity throughout year

modern multiviscosity oils change viscosity much less temperature
 result viscosity graphs cross over several curves multivis
specification pegs curve two temperatures normal operating
temperature cold one though i cant remember numbers

 any event weights do indicate significant difference remember
 your engine temperatureregulated thermostat 
radiator air fins most time unless you overheat 
something

any weight oil better than oil than very old carbonized
oil thin oil wont general lubricate well temperature
thicker oil like w lubricate better temperature 
 well during startup when most engine wear occurs 

 youre planning making long drives w probably fine
esp summer your w car youre making short drives
stick w



dont drink soap dilute dilute ok
