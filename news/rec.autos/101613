 biggest problem some people seem having saturn
 dealers make k car i think most agree me car 
 comparably priced its competitors arent overpriced 
 compared most cars class i dont understand point 
 arguing over whether dealer makes k 
 
 i have never understood what big deal over dealer profits either
 only thing i can figure out people believe 
 minimize dealer profit minimize total outofpocket
 expenses car while may true some cases i do 
 believe generally true i bought saturn sl january 
 time based studying car prices i decided 
 comparable car priced cheaply saturn sure maybe i
 could have talked price some other car saturn price 
 my outofpocket expenses wouldnt have been any different whats important
 me how much money i have left after i buy car reducing dealer profit
 same thing saving money show me how reducing dealer profit
 saves me money ill believe its important my experience has
 been reducing dealer profit does necessarily save me money

say you bought your saturn k dealer profit k
 dealer profit you would only paying k 
 same car so isnt saving money

yes point prices competetive saturn may
well selling car intended giving dealer profit 
since comperable honda profit more expensive may well
worth buy saturn

moreover saturn really does reduce dealer profit margin 
 cars even better deals say price saturn 
already below market average class cars after 
reduce dealer profit would below market average 

 attract even more people buy saturns because would save them money
 
 force competitors lower prices survive

now only saturn owners benefit from lower dealer profit even 
 buyers other cars pay less


 necessarily seems me saturn salesdroids who dont 
make commision whereas counterparts other dealerships generally
do make more per hour whatever means saturn doesnt give up
 profit employees through commision which taken out per
car profits just pass along less pressureing salesmenwomen

isnt saving money

maybe maybe depends accounting practices id rather pay
more dealer service doesnt cut corners contain costs
