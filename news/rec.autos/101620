i am person who started out subject

 me question really about dealer profit 
amount money type car ive settled 
new subaru wagon similar amount money saturn
dealer asked sw ok i know its model i think
i got better car though i have adjust my initial idea 
why i am getting new car

today during conversion friend i learned he rejected
 saturn ford tarurs only costed him little bit more
than sl i may wrong loaded tarus beats saturn sl

i agree fullyloaded sl would come close price 
lowerend ford taurus fullyloaded taurus other hand would still
 substantially more expensive than even most glitzy sl fully loaded
sl would run somewhere around while fully loaded taurus lx would 
somewhere around range base taurus gl i believe might
start around course taurus sho which can push 
 you really try totally different car than your mainstream
taurus sedan your statement entirely faulty just little
inaccurate


i cant see saturn better value why i puzzled
 its pricings oh we did spend much time getting our deals
being better informed has its advantages

well thats ok least youre bitching about dealer profits like some
 other netters you seem have rationally picked out car 
 best you loyale aging design about replaced 
 impreza wagon so you probably got good deal one last ones


 again i may wrong
