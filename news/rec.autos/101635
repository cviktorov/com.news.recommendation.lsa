 q what ka band radar where used should radar detector 
 able handle 
 
 ka band has recently been made available fcc use us
 socalled photoradar installations installations 
 lowpowered beam aimed across road degree angle 
 direction traffic picture taken vehicles which 
 radar unit determines have been violation speed limit
 tickets mailed owner vehicle because low
 power degree angle many people believe radar
 detector cannot give reasonable warning ka band radar unit
 although some manufacturers radar detectors have added 
 capability anyway number locales where photoradar use
 limited some question legality units best advice
 learn what photo radar units look like keep track where 
 used else dont speed

photo radar mailed tickets make sense all speeding moving 
violation committed operator owner owner may 
rental agency dealer private party government agency long
 owner has reason expect operator driving illegally
 unsafely owner cannot held responsible what operator does
 car may even have been driven without owners knowledge consent 
i cant believe mailed ticket where driver identified would 
stand up court obviously lazy cynical boneheaded fascist 
way extort revenue has nothing do public safety

we had those fg photoradar things here sweden while ago
 lot fuzz about them lot sabotage too spraycan
 touchup paint can do lot good

eventually had drop idea were lot courtcases
where owner car could prove he didnt drive time
 speeding

i especially recall case where eventually proved carthief 
had stolen car made false plates he ofcourse chose license number
 identical car so photo seemed correct

 conclosion photoradar sucks every way you look
