i am market used chevy suburban have observed 
prices models diesel engines run about less than
comparable models gas engine

 has reason 

yes consumer confusion early s 
fuel crisis etc everyone wanted better fuel mileage diesel fuel
 cheapest fuel available usually provides better mileage
than comparable gasoline engines so gm decided conver 
 gas engine diesel engine i think liter big
mistake engine redesigned converted engine
could handle higher compression etc lots problems 
 cars thew up big red flag casual observer 
dont buy diesel bad gross generalization

ask yourself question your livelihood depended driving
lots would you use dependable undependable cheaper
 short run vehicle what do greyhound busses have them
trailer trucks even train locomotives gasoline engines
 diesel tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide 
 mile warrantee vehicles

i own diesel suburban l diesel great engine
just keeps going more expensive when new than gasoline
engine vehicle only problem diesel engines 
when need rebuilt expensive gas 
engine you pay about rebuild diesel l about
 again diesel engine lasts about twice long
 gets about better mileage carburator gasoline engine
costs about rebuild less rebuild fuel injection
pump diesel cost about more again
you never need tuneup
