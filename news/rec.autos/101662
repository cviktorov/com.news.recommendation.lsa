i know its long shot maybe someone went through have
some comments share

 story i bought car out state im trying get
 safety inspection pennsylvania problem car has 
aftermarket tint all windows except windshield tint rather
weak you can clearly see inside car through tint

 inspection garage said wont pass unless i get 
waiver from state police so i went state police 
officer told me aftermarket tint illegal i can get 
waiver only pre car medical reason i asked him 
show me section vehicle code says its illegal he
showed me paraghaph said you cant have tint 
you cant see inside car because tint when i told
him you can fact see inside very well he shut book
 said its just illegal fact we can have someone give you
 ticket right now well wont argue 

since vehicle code says its ok long you can see through 
tint id like keep ill reread vehicle code 
library id also like get some sort paper from police
 says its ok so i can get inspection so i wont
get trouble tint later i also wouldnt mind registering
 complaint against officer he really pissed me off

so does anyone have any experience getting sort paper from
 police especially pennsylvania does anyone have any experience
registering complaint against officer i called station 
later today basically said place where i
could register complaint against officer i do decide
 keep tint get ticket anyway how much chance do
i stand succesfully appeal ticket court

any comments about welcome
