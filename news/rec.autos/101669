quad reliable yeah whats your definition reliable thats reliable
 its safe say integra engines general near perfect
 mention hell alot smoother quieter balance shaftsthe acura has engine
 wins reliablity contest hands down you can rev car all day everyday
 youll never blow hose crack block anything else i speak
from expierence
im saying quad bad engine dont highlight reliability when you
comparing acura engine while integra costs alot more 

 couple things blowing hose doesnt speak engine reliability 
while true quads have problem head gasket leaks 
 design flaw gasket has been corrected also i know pontiac 
replacing head gaskets leak free yeark miles other than
 i have found my quad completely solid direct ignition 
system means wiresrotorrotorcap ever deal also hydrolic lifters
mean valve adjustments ever im badmouthing integra engine i just
think you going overboard slamming quad you quite correct
 integra engine quieter although i would say smoother my
quad loves rev especially highend do you have any evidence
 blocks cracking quads i have heard
