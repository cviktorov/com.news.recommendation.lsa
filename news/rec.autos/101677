ok how about argue about why does sl have much lower base
price than sc its over k cheaperi forget exact amount
doesnt cost more have extra doorswindowslocksmotors etc 
 door perhaps just marketing dealpeople want 
door so pay extra k

ok heres what i understand

 slslslswsw meant compete following cars

honda civic
toyota tercel slsl
toyota corolla slsl
nissan sentra
mazda protoge
subaru loyaleimpreza
isuzu stylus
geo prizm
ford escort
mercury tracer
mistubishi mirage
plymouthdodge colt


 core competition civic corolla sentra most other
models same class arent first cars you would think 
i threw escorttracer because has good amount japanese
technology has similar reliability stats i didnt include domestic small
cars cavalier sunbird shadow sundance tempo topaz since i
think saturn going after cars have least some degree japanese
roots

 scsc meant compete against following cars

toyota paseo
honda civic sicivic coupesdel sol si
nissan nxnx
mazda mx
isuzu impulse
geo storm
ford escort gt


 you look prices cars theyre more expensive than theyre
door counterparts good reason more upscale 
trenddriven market even though many models based sedan
platforms interior etc good enough warrant slightly higher
prices here some platform derivations i can think 

tercel paseo
sentra nxnx
civic del sol
 mx sure one
stylus impulsestorm

 illustrate tercel starts around while paseo starts 
around even door tercel cost less than door paseo now
you might saying tercel doesnt offer power some doors
offer what i mean dr tercel comparable
powerplant its sport coupe derivative lets take another example 
isuzu stylus xs impulse xsstorm gsi both have same powerplants 
l hp engine smaller dr coupes generally more expensive
again because twodoor sport coupe market more
fashionoriented trendsetting segment people willing pay more
money type car 


 short even though scsc may smaller hence less car its market
orientation dictates slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent
sedan slsl version

i hope clears things up bit
