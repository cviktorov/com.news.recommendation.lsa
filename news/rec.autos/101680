 you do so you putting lives others road consider
able risk why do you think mechanics ase certified anyway you put
 you need those fancy scmancy gadgets

awww right you want all home mechanics lined up against wall 
shot eh

bull pucky you chicken read service manual get your head out 
sand certainly tools job cheaper than alignment
rack do job competently albeit swiftly 
more accurate due natural pride ownermechanic places his work
you can do acceptable job aligning car using simple tools 
some imaginative work would never have effect endangering
anyones life worst happens your tires wear oddly well
you could have wheels aiming totally pigeon toed able
 steer car raise your hands those think vision 
so poor would screw up badly

i bet you one those people feels honing cylinder wall
 sand paper kill millions people aint magic go take 
certification course look people have never learned add
 whole life taking certification

btw i am disgusted colt some other chrysler offerings
because go out alignment you sneaze them my chrysler
laser similar daytona reskinned colt needed realignment every
 months bolt good grade x each wheel using carefully welded
spacer jig measure toe adjust manufacturer specs camber bit more
difficult adjust measure i used micrometer measure 
space between rim funky bent up pipe could placed 
upper lower portions rim inside wheel hard explain
 same tool could used instead xs i had made tools up
right after last alignment done professionally so i had reference 
 original poster might
