 experience jeep service dept 

while exactly service incident i had similar experience recently 
when i bought new truck

i had picked out vehicle i wanted after little haggling we 
agreed price i wrote them check down payment plus tax
 license told them id back evening pick up truck 
when i returned i had wait about hour before finance guy could 
get me when i finally got everything went smoothly until he 
started adding up numbers he discovered had 
miscalculated tax license about he said he needed 
another from me i said we had already agreed price 
 problem i wasnt giving them any more money finance guy 
brought manager duty who proceeded give me hard time i 
reminded him i customer i didnt think i should 
treated like he didnt back off he could forget whole 
deal he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick 
snatched back my check left needless say were pleased 
 turn events

early next morning i got call from general sales manager wanting 
 know what happened i related story he apologised profusely 
asked anything could do change my mind i told him 
 gave me truck free i probably still wouldnt take 
 were other dealers town i repeat customer theirs 
 should learn how treat customersetcetci still 
pretty steamed about whole affair he gave me line about hating 
lose customer would try find solution etc etc i told 
him bother thanks id go somewhere else

 couple hours later owner dealership called me all 
apologetic etc etc etc said would cover plus 
knock another off price truck i told him id think about 
 he gave me his private direct phone number his secretarys name 
 assured me valued me customer etc etc etc

i thought about few hours discussed my wife we 
decided what hellthat pretty decent deal so i called him 
back accepted his offer when i went back next day pick up 
truck i received royal treatment everyone seemed know about 
incident even lot boy everything went smoothly i out 
 my new truck about mins

so i guess im reasonably satisfied customer however should 
have happened first place i bit shocked have sales 
person talk me like i dont expect them bow grovel i 
sure dont expect given hard time either esp when its 
mistake

anyway im happy truck turned out couple hundred 
dollars under invoice paid most first years license fee 
im sure whether ill go back dealer tho
