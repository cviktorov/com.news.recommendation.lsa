crossposting

crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name included 
 newsgroups line article header articles appear
 all newsgroups listed

crossposting one most misunderstood misused facilities 
usenet you should only post group because you feel article 
appropriate you should never crosspost just reach particular
audience distinction subtle important radar detector
articles example moreorless appropriate recautos 
almost never appropriate scielectronics rechamradio fact
 you might want reach audience scielectronics 
rechamradio adequate justification posting either group

crossposting between any all recautos groups usually
inappropriate you find yourself doing so consider whether 
truly advisable before sending your article consider setting followupto
 point only one newsgroup you feel you must crosspost

crossposting between recautos miscconsumers chancy best 
particular flame wars over speed limit us andor use 
radar detectors should never crossposted between any groups

most readers scielectronics recradio couldnt care less about
 police radar radar detector arguments go endlessly 
recautos

 excellent idea check newsgroups followupto lines 
articles before posting followup particular wary posting 
misctest recartsstartrek talkbizarre any combination 
three life you save may your own

distribution

 field header any news article which allows you 
partially control where article goes called distribution
field may very useful many reasons should also serve
 reminder news very large widespread system

 distribution recautos fairly extensive writing 
 automotive newsgroups known reach most europe australia
new zealand some locations japan mind i offer 
following hints about use distribution field your article
headers article content

 please take care send forsale ads about clapped out ford
mavericks new jersey france california i doubt anyone 
either place care except my girlfriend who some strange
reason likes mavericks only door mavericks 

 when posting technical questions please include market which
your car manufactured example number differences
between europeanmarket ford escort usmarket escort likewise
all cc early cc alfa romeos reached us spica fuel
injection european market cars usually got carbs often webers 
differences can important your readers make your situation clear
failure do so can lead pointless flame wars significant
spread misinformation

 careful about your capacities specifications when posting
 us we get mix metric english system values whereas
europe almost entirely metric system future edition
 monthly posting contain list commonlyused
abbreviations may known some places recautos
reaches cuts both ways so let us parochial about 

 use distribution field limit where your article goes when
possible within north america values na north america can
canada usa may used addition twoletter state
abbreviations us supported some cases eg i wanted
 send article only new york new jersey i could put
nynj distribution field note multiple commaseparated
values legal distribution fields vary widely however so
you should check your local sysadmin find out what likely
 supported your area

 dangers overgeneralization

 amplify warning from distribution section article
 wary making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc what 
true buick cid engine may quite utterly wrong 
 honda cc engine headlight laws sweden decidedly
different from those idaho

 need adequate specification

when you ask question please give reasonable amount information
eg you have question about your honda please specify year
model engine size etc otherwise most answers your question may 
quite useless


concerning lemons

 one time another every auto manufacturer has manufactured lemon 
two even honda admits please dont waste everyones time 
announcing world your brand x automobile terrible so all
brand x automobiles terrible so one should ever buy car from
 brand x company articles worse than useless because 
cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little useful
information


concerning flames

 much we might wish flamefree newsgroup something most
likely never occur here some guidelines flames how
 deal them list flameprone topics follows next section
 posting

 you post something truly obnoxious inflammatory dont imagine 
minute including words flames work wont 
youll get exactly what you deserve

 youre going flame youre more likely get away you can
cite fact maybe wellknown reference one likely believe
bald unsupported assertions

 careful about who you choose insult consider insulting anyone


asking question

 bad idea post question end phrase like please
send email i dont read group much better idea 
end question please send email sufficient interest
ill summarize results later posting i may miss posted responses
 request

answering question

 someone wants hop up yugo dont tell them get mustang
either silent give them useful advice someone wants advice 
defending speeding ticket dont tell them obey law next time 
its offensive presumes guilt which proven doesnt directly
address original question general dont post order see
your words print dont post order enjoy feeling smug 
selfrighteous


stale andor inflammatory topics

certain topics considered stale old timers while discussion 
them certainly ok new factual information welcome ravings
about them extremely tiresome may get person who posts them
ignored altogether some topics naturally inflammatory 
difficult impossible have meaningful discussion them some
 topics include following
