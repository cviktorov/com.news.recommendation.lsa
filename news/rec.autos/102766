i saw interesting product ny auto show would like 
hear your comments

militechtm yet another oil additive demonstration 
product really impressive didnt cheat

 setup demo fairly simple cone shaped rotor 
half submerged small oil sink filled motor oil rotor
 powered electronic motor metal pad pressed against
 rotor using torque wrench until rotor stopped friction 
 torque needed stop rotor read from torque wrench

before militech added rotor stopped about lbft
 torque you pick brand oil difference once militech 
added oil rotor could stopped even lbft 
torque 

here good part even after salesman emptied oil sink 
you still could stopped rotor thin film remained 

 say you need only add oz per quart oil every k miles oz
bottle 

i still have my doubts product really so great why 
so little known salesman said widely used military i didnt
believe demo so impressive i bought bottle against
my common sense

has anyone heard actually used product real
 you going auto show please visit stand 
second floor see can find out demo hoax
