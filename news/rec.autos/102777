growth about size national geographic magazine sticking out
 front fender which incorporated amber parking lights amber side
marker lightsreflectors white cornering lamps like american luxury
cars aimed towards side road when you have your turn indicators
 white backup lights aimed towards back car when you
have selected reverse gear glossy brochure showed how front
mounted backup lights were useful illuminating hazards pot holes kids
