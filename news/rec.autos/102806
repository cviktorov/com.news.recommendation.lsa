 happened about year ago washington dc beltway
snot nosed drunken kids decided would really cool 
throw huge rocks down cars from overpass four five
cars were hit were several serious injuries sadly
 small girl sitting front seat one them struck 
 head one larger rocks i dont recall she 
made i think she comatose month so 
doctors werent holding out hope shed live

what hell happening great country ours i
can see boyhood pranks peeing off bridges 
 pound rocks has our society really stooped low

 yes nobody watching them get caught punishment
 all old days behaviour would rewarded whipping
 goodsized belt taken some hospital see first hand
 what kind damage accidents cause course doesnt happen
 any more whipping would probably save kids life teaching
 him some respect others person little respect would
 inevitably wind up dead early anyway

 problem creeping gradualism you put frog hot water
 he just jumps out you put him cold water everso
 gradually heat frog cook what entertainment
 industry lack religious moral educational standards our
 modern north american society have done us over years now 
 we about cooked we may have woken up too late

society we have known coming apart seams basic reason
 human life has been devalued point were killing someone 
 big deal kids see hundreds murderous acts tv we can abort 
children demand kill sick old so why surprised
when some kids drop lbs rocks kill people dont care because 
message hear life cheap

 education system religious leaders arent doing much 
 about either both parents working society where 
 stabilizing influence home latchkey children everywhere
 latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos listen 
 whatever violent hatepromoting music videos like because 
 one home stop 

 day age when about times more things learn
 than when i went school our answer increased knowledge 
 shorter school hours more leisure time i say keep kids 
 school longer feed them good food teach them something when
 get home have parent interact monitor them 
 very old now forgotten proverb child left his own 
 bring parent grief daycare systems answer 
 just shifting parents own responsibilities off someone else 
 whom its lifelong committment rather just job
