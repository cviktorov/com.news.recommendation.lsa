i am beyond under age group i have experience few
years ago might interesting you i owned toyota celica
gt i decided buy myself gift more exotic car front runners
included toyota supra turbo porsche model years
i narrowed down those two i liked simplicity handling
 snob appeal too driving porsche supra turbo less
money had more features performance almost personal luxury
car had better acceleration higher top speed than 
i almost ready give buying impulse i
decided stop my insurance agents office way i asked
about what would happen my rate either car
 
 you buy supra your rate classification same 
 celica celica considered subcompact 
year rated one safest cars slight increase because
 car years newer our lowerrisk division continue
 handle your account
 
 you buy porsche well have change you standard
higher rate company your rate double you go 
 its another story again well cover rest year
 cancel you after 
 
 supra much faster than actually
faster than standard doenst make sense
 
 thats what book says we dont insure corvettes either 
some reason underwriters consider supras drivers 
 very traditional conservative
 
i eventually went supra number reasons porsche
dealer had nice salesman get me interested tough highpressure
guy back room equal monthly payments would have taken
 year longer pay porsche plus its higher insurance i
concluded high insurance related probability auto
theft

 month thats k personalk totalk property 
 deductible glass towing state farm
 
 
 
unless you under have been driving less than 
years i think you being seriously ripped off i dont have
one performance cars you listed your record 
clean you should paying over k
 
did you try calling all insurance dealers you could find
although rates supposed standardized ive found 
most places i initially call give me some ridiculously high
quote finaly i hit one much lower
 
also i have changed insurance companies when rate went up 
renewal accidents tickets car gets older maintain low
rate you always have careful when comes insurance
companies 
 
good luck
