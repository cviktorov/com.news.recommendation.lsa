excellent automatic can found subaru legacy switches 
sport mode when electronics figure when driver sets
 switch which proper way do imo so what does sport
mode entail several things

 revving red line rev limiter case legacy

 delayed upshifts ie you lift off briefly remain 
low gear handy you charging through corners 
would like do without distraction upshifts when theres
another curve approaching

 part throttle downshifts based speed which pedal 
depressed rather than position pedal modern
electronics can measure very easily switch sport mode
 wonderful you want charge through green light about
 turn red my audi senses very well can downshift 
little half throttle my right foot fast enough

also i think smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage
than dumb driver stick all else being equal remember 
 idea stick being more economical than automatic makes 
big assumption driver smart enough know what gear 
use each situation how many times have you ridden 
inattentive driver cruising highway th gear 
 speed 

how many people who drive manuals really know what best
gear use every conceivable situation im sure 
 some who know i suspect chip controlled automatic 
all possible scenarioratio combinations stored rom likely do
better i can also say all my previous assumptions were proved
wrong after i got car instantaneous mpg readout high gear
low revs wide open throttle more economical than low gear high
revs small throttle opening explanation quite simple 
one sits down think about obvious first sight
