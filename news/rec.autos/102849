 when i bought new truck
 i had picked out vehicle i wanted after little haggling we 
 agreed price i wrote them check down payment plus tax
 license told them id back evening pick up truck 
 when i returned i had wait about hour before finance guy could 
 get me when i finally got everything went smoothly until he 
 started adding up numbers he discovered had 
 miscalculated tax license about he said he needed 
 another from me i said we had already agreed price 
 problem i wasnt giving them any more money finance guy 

 similar thing happend me year ago i bought used ford bronco
which has since been stolen few weeks after i paid
 took delivery sent letter telling me goofed 
miscalculated license renewal i need send
 check avoid further delay processing my registration
 thing i had already received pink slip from dmv so
i ignored i received another letter phone calls
started coming first from finance guy from general
manager both hounding me extra money left me alone
once i told them i already had paperwork pointed out clause
 contract stated final price just final
afterall wouldnt budge i had told them i wanted another
 off after deal had been signed right i told them 
 call again i would do business them future
 didnt seem have problem after all
