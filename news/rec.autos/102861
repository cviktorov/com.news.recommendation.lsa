compare either porsche you tell me which designed

oh right only dollar cars should driven fast
 drive goddamn rabbits mph europe pal i reckon
 taurus least capable rabbit

my whole point say cars couldnt go fast
 shouldnt go fast family sedan designed 
operable mph doesnt suddenly become operable mph because
you added some plastic aero effects slightly wider tires much
larger engine thats what sho slightly modified family
sedan powerful engine didnt even bother improving 
brakes

 mustang essentially same deal sho big power
plant stuck midsize sedan almost other modifications
i have reallife experience mustang handles like 
brick except when youre invoking oversteer course something i
personally avoid doing highway stopping power 
inadequate even from mph lots accelleration rest 
 car up par

i picked porsche example because designed speed 
mind didnt have could have been much
cheaper one several mercedes audi models all 
cars fairly expensive so parts make them
drivable high speed should elementary

 few things keep mind about europe since you brought
 up my autobahn knowledge admittedly secondhand i believe
 following true

 drivers much better disciplined europe than here
 roads comprising autobahn much better designed than
 here usually include animal fences makes them
 far more predictable than most us highways
 all europe autobahn most places europe have
 speed limits arent outofline what we used have 
 us my friends werent lying me theyre typically 
 much higher than kmh

i strongly suspect you wont find lot rabbit owners doing mph
nearly kmh autobahn i could wrong some people
have respect own lives

you certainly havent convinced me

 course speedingisbad speedingisillegal 
iwillnotspeed ilovebigbrother you had your mind made up
already

 you think so you sure dont pay attention my postings
