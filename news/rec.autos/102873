driving straight line fine you very soon become aclimated 
 its only rush when corners you dont
think you can make

 clear autobahn nothing us people 
all judges would label you insane difficult persuade
people otherwise

sure surface condition most good autobahns far better

 quality autobahns something myth road surface
isnt much different typical tx freeway better
 terms lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc id have
 problem driving most us freeways i save 
 backroads which really more likely dangerous

than most roads here dip asphalt you test your
shocks kill you dont get me wrong i love 

 would have quite severe i dont recall any us freeway
without road damage warnings i would regard unsafe
 any decent well damped car note my definition
 decent well damped would exclude most typical american sedans

drive quickly say my probe do thats more
than ive ever tried cause isnt decent enough piece
 road hereabouts

i dont know where you live i would much more worried
about cops other traffic etc than road surface 
 just isnt fast dangerous you have probe
gt problem cyl models i have driven would 
likely unpredictable higher speeds
