excuse me i understood what mr smith meant i have often observed 
when traffic blocked solid few people yeild moron
who impatiently riding bumpers slug front pack 
miraculously wake up change lanes viola more jam granted 
situation here does apply rush hour crowded city i have
observed situation regularly your average interstate six 
eight sets cars side side bunched up pack open 
freeway fore aft far you can see people who refuse 
yeild point honor just annoying slug front

i agree traffic all blocked up you want pass you might
 feel like moving over someone behind you because you dont want 
give them one carlength when should just wait like you 
 youre one those people just sits behind person 
doesnt flash them high beams pull left flash them 
ride bumper otherwise tell them you do fact want 
go youre just drafting them get hell out 
way someone who i especially hate when you flash someone 
 back line dont pass 

so after ive flashed my lights chap front he doesnt
pass few any do what next major highways more
lanes each direction keeping extreme right blocks folks who
 entering also someone posted thread here dc
area we have few left lane exits sounds like you wait until
 last minute get left lane you wont cause yoyos
wont make room

we have particularly bad strech here merryland just over cabin
john bridge two very long entry ramps which all hurryup
yahoos dive cause want get ahead when we get point
where ramps merge all hell breaks lose result traffic
which moving va side bridge stalls tother
side dingbats had stayed lane allowed folks coming up
