stuff about autobahn safety sho speed deleted
 mustang essentially same deal sho big power

 mustang much worse case design irresponsibility than 
sho 
plant stuck midsize sedan almost other modifications
i have reallife experience mustang handles like 
brick except when youre invoking oversteer course something i

its hard predicatbaly drift stock mustang because
 suspension

personally avoid doing highway stopping power 
inadequate even from mph lots accelleration rest 
 car up par

yes when i think mustang i think schoolbus f motor 
my mind mustang should fitted speed limiter 
 so just isnt safe check out your local junkyard mustangs
outnumber other cars proportion way excess sales 
junkyards

i find astonishing cu somesuchlike has jumped 
mustang poor brakes relation power ford should least
standardize svo rear brakes all s




i picked porsche example because designed speed 
mind didnt have could have been much
cheaper one several mercedes audi models all 
cars fairly expensive so parts make them
drivable high speed should elementary

 few things keep mind about europe since you brought
 up my autobahn knowledge admittedly secondhand i believe
 following true

 drivers much better disciplined europe than here

true northern europe latin countries something else

 roads comprising autobahn much better designed than
kindof true remember were build adolf s

 here usually include animal fences makes them
 far more predictable than most us highways

yes

 all europe autobahn most places europe have

autobahn german word freeway other countries have
different names loose equivalents autostrada autoroute motorway
etc

 speed limits arent outofline what we used have 
 us my friends werent lying me theyre typically 
 much higher than kmh

europe did seem brink kmh limit hasnt passed 
far i know typical speeds western europe much higher than
 us law enforcement negligible my experience comapred
 us revenue enhancement motivation things
you really notice higher speed differentials more
professional attitude driving you just never see two cars
running parallel mph oblivious all around them


i strongly suspect you wont find lot rabbit owners doing mph
nearly kmh autobahn i could wrong some people

youre wrong gtis go fast just kind noisy ideal

autobahn car lot times you see cars being driven drivers
foot floor how do i know when youre making any ground
 identical car front you

have respect own lives

 something happens youre dead same goes much
over driving high speed forces you concentrate i feel much
safer driving autobahn than typical us traffic
because most people seem awake ive never seen any driver reading
 book autobahn i see all too often us

craig

 just doesnt seem fast after minutes so aclimation everybody
drives fast big deal 

craig

you certainly havent convinced me

 course speedingisbad speedingisillegal 
iwillnotspeed ilovebigbrother you had your mind made up
already

 you think so you sure dont pay attention my postings
