 just warning everybody net watch out 
folks standing next road overpasses can
cause serious harm you your car

pm last night i travelling interstate here 
knoxville i taking offramp exit another interstate
 my wife suddenly screamed something large hit side
 my truck we slowed down after looking back see 
vandals standing we drove police station

she did get good look guy saw him cock his arm 
something size cinderblock i never saw him we 
very lucky truck sits up high road would have hit
her window would have killed her 

 police looking guy all likelyhood he gone
