i wish i had figures me back me up i recall
statistics showing women tended have more accidents than men
 damage generally quite minor men had fewer far more
expensive accidents rate total vehicle destruction 
significantly higher men than women particularly younger
male age groups

imho social considerations probably strongest influence here
possibly more so than any difference between sexes social
influences often affect type car thats bought 
situations car used type car driving
situations have major effect accident risk thus society
expects you buy mustang race street youre more
likely do our society expects males more than
females

i agree some your social influences driving conditions
 lets get real here guys dont drag race becuase expected too
we do becuase its fun we find out whose car faster 
guys drive different than women becuase men when driver 
driving unusually i can usually figure out male female
driver without looking driver
social influences may give person more reason buy vehicle 
has certain amount character which he she would like associated
 do you change your driving habits when one around

sheesh i dont know what kind women have where you guys live
 some ladies here who blow your doors off least
 try we just cant let youngsters get too uppity
 us old folks
