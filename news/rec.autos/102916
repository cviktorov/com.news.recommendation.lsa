wasnt original intent reverse lights driver so he
could see where he backing up although reverse lights sides

 reverse lights warn others you backing up 
arent bright enough typically see without brake tail
lights 

i dont know where you live i couldnt get out my driveway
 night without reverse lights someone said out country
you notice neat little things like stars difference between
day night night around my house which amongst forest 
rather tall oaks dark except nights full moons
reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up i greatly
prefer cars them cars without operational reverse lights
