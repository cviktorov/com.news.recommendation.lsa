jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says

can anyone offer any opinions ford probe ala how do 
 long run repair records reliability mileage etc

i am fixing buy car next few months aiming toward something
 little bigger than typical small car little more power i
am considering mx probe accord corolla sx 

i bought probe gt pep last july now miles
after debating over sentra sernx mx mr stealth prelude 
 celica

 car design different than earlier years so its too early see its
reliability so far what its worth my comments

my dislikes
shutting door windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal

some other owners fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented 
about problem i havent seen happen my month old 
 probe gt i think may something ford has corrected since 
 initial batch cars also someone said ford has issued 
service bulletin inform dealers about how correct problem so you 
may able get your dealer fix 

headlights have stuck up few times weather
air conditioning broke miles pressure cycling switch
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely

havent seen any problems nor have i seen mentioned 
mailing list so might just having bad luck 

crammed engine little hope doityourselfers typical

definitely

parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts
underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways speedbumps typical
assembly gripes tape radiator screw fell out dash seat seams 
stitched properly hopefully just fluke

 problems like either i havent been able find any obvious 
places where screwed up

ford only gives key car cmon ford spend extra few pennies

hmmm i got two keys my car something tells me you got stiffed 
your dealer actually you count credit card key 
came owners binder i got keys since credit card key
doesnt have any teeth cut yet i guess i wont count 

rear hatch has padding corners when up im waiting day when
i bash my head corner
horn buttons behind air bag spokes center personal preference

 latter probably because air bag its pretty much takes up
all space where youd expect find horn

speaking horn i surprised find probe comes one
 those nice merican sounding horns instead japanese sounding kind
 previous probes had japanese horns

tires fling dirtmud onto side car 

yeah very badly enough annoying sometimes

my likes
engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque definitely 
handling very good fwd understeer only limits
transmission speed must
usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere
very little torque steer full power much better than sho i drive
stability mph high gearing though
low cowl good visibility front
heated outside mirrors nice fog never tested freezing weather
absair bag see above
rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so trunk important
 shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still
tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping k 

i agree strongly all above especially about engine 
interior very very nice too very pleasing eye ergonomically
sound


i drive from work
each day relatively smooth roads most noticable thing 
probes suspension doesnt like potholes when you test drive one find 
potholed road somewhere around town see jarring you get 
tolerable

yes cars stiff suspension isnt everyone i personally like 
 you find little harsh otherwise like car id strongly
suggest looking mx

 you have passengers all means bring them along too theyll find
 have room back youll find car rides
differently thats better up you 

 problem back seat theres leg room plenty 
head room though shorter people fit back without any complaints
so long seat sitting behind pulled forward bit 
give them place put feet

also theres lot glass
around you which i wasnt expecting temperature inside car gets pretty
hot summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about
 lack ventilation you may want consider when combined 
 heat

 power moonroof can greatly improve ventilation throughout car 
i really enjoy moonroof way ive always been sucker
 open air driving leakage problems anything like thatyet

ive heard exhaust system has trouble mine works fine

i havent heard about one i know some very early probes
 maybe had problems prematurely rusting mufflers which
ford replace charge i havent heard about anything like
 concerning probes

i havent had any real trouble car outside cv joint boot
 leaking dealer took care promptly even
gave me free rental car day half i without my
car i quite happy way handledespecially considering
 i expecting worst from them

from what ive heard sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems 
 probe probably mx when first went production 
i think problems have mostly been corrected point thats
almost always expected completely new car like though

hope helps
