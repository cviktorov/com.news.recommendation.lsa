 exactly my point lot hostility from teenagers

 you follow news northwest usa you have heard 
 group year old boys barely out teens certainly outlook
 developed during teens just shot killed innocent little
 girl riding car seattle area when her mother who driving
 honked her horn car boys really upsetting
 makes my stomach turn would any parents doesnt your heart
 just go out poor mother
 teenagers both drive cars involved automotive vandalism 
 crime maybe someone newsgroup has had specific experience 
 dealing violent teenage offenders like kids same

 seems sad people lose all perspective when here about 
case violence teenagers

 little perspective

how about thousands kind teenagers who volunteer local
agencies help children seniors homeless

did you read about all kids stanford who spent spring
breaks helping out inner city areas what about hundreds 
volunteers teenagers others who worked clean up mess
after rodney king riots la

have you gone your local high school play recently attended 
school orchestra performances have you seen how many kids volunteer
 pick up trash plant trees do walkathons how many kids have
tried sell you stuff benefit organizations belong how
many girl scout cookies have you bought how many chocolate bars 
good causes

 media picks up all anomalies sensational

what about wonderful teenagers all over place who work hard 
school get good grades go college work make real
contribution our society

all humans teenagers some time lives mother theresa
 teenager so geoffrey dahmer

 really sad see so many people who buy sensational
reporting media some kind reflection world today
 reflection what happening outer fringes our
society nothing more
