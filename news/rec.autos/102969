wharf wrat rites

 were designed speeds upwards i forget 
exact spec military vehicles thats dodge 
powerwagon ford taurus

ever once while you still see reference super
slab system interstate defense highways whether
 military has much anything goes road 
another matter few most whompedup diesel trucks
maybe load permitting military surplus stuff ive
driven jeep classic willyskaiseramc preindependent
suspension power wagons slant crewcab pickup
werent exactly congenial highway speeds i wouldnt
swear any them would do except bedload semi

you just gotta love standard military tire too 
least one used use designed circa ww ii 
compromise between traction icky sticky goo longevity
 sharp rocks so forth its quite illadapted high
speeds civilian roadways those who cant remember
what look like imagine mountainbike tire 
road rib middle scaled up car size oh yeah 
narrow too one standard mods civilizing surplus 
jeep install tires wheels reflected some 
 advancements made ride handling since dday

 point made wharfie others still stands 
youre going do milspec power wagon 
jeep tank transporter other unwieldy rubbertired
vehicle anywhere id suggest american interstate 
your safe speed tends limited more your car
 skills road maintenance swarms fools around
you roads were designed going like devil

naturally neither i nor my employer advocates unsafe 
unlawful driving
