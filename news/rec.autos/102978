hello netters

im visiting us im from sweden august i probably rent chevy
beretta from alamo ive been quoted week additional days
 would include free driving distance local taxes baltimore 
 also told me all insurance thats necessary included i doubt 
 cause friend rented car last year turned out he needed lot more
insurance than whats included base price other hand he 
didnt rent from alamo

does anyone have some info 

 ripoff 
 sounds pretty reasonable car city

probability ill needing more insurance
unless you have accident you wont need more you plan 
paying car credit card check see your card
automatically covers rental cars also your own auto insurance may
cover rental cars also

most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent 
require you initial several spots you dont want 
credit cards personal auto insurance provide same sort 
coverage rental agency trying sell

i have never rented from alamo so i dont know follow 
same practice

 beretta good rental car
yes compact door probably bit dull performance 
accelerationwise very adequate have automatic
transmission amfm stereo air conditioning possibly power 
windows door locks
