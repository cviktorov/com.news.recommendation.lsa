i sold my sprint last april k id driven since
 previous july putting k miles sensor light used 
light up regularly starting about k miles after i bought 
my brother i rebuilt engine used all original equipment
so i suppose sensor could have used replacement performance hah
 you could call did change perhaps emissions increased
 how much emissions could caregistered cylinder engine produce
