 long time motorcyclist i have never understood what
posessed auto builders put delicate controls which must
 used skill finesse like clutches brakes
 floor

why hand control its much much easier

 early days neither functions had powerassist so
only legs had enough strength activate them since its
been traditional people would have hard time getting
used anything else 

well where exactly would you put hand clutch brake 
 motorcycle its easy handlebars have very limited
range turning steering wheels other hand turn around
 around aroundwhich fine electrical relays like
your cruise control airbagbut how many you want 
lose your clutch andor brake due short circuit

shades edsel had pushbuttons steering wheel hub
 controlled auto tranny very disconcerting shift
 reverse when turning corner wires shorted

 workarounds theres really reason use hand
power cars clutch brakes lightening them 
point finesse controls suitable hand use
would increse mechanical complexity substantially look 
power brakes nonpower brakes example

i saw experimental car had joystick instead steering
wheel

thats about useless imho 

another automotive oddity separate keys trunks doors 
ignitions why earth would you want 

i know i dont

i want separate trunk key security reasons gives me totally
separate lockable container door ignitionehhh same keys
ok i guess
