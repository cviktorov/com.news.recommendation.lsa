i agree never have dealer add anything your car you want ac
make sure factory installedhondas maybe excluded many cant 
bought ac installed factory i think maybe actually
use all needed parts true factory install when put one inas
 bigger radiator etcor designed properly st place
anyway my point dealer installed ac wont anywhere near good
 factory service bums mess up your car when installing 
scratches screwdriver holes seatsparts reinstalled correctly 
 all screws etc i know guy who has been service manager gm
dealer yearshe said never have dealer add anything your car
except maybe floormats
