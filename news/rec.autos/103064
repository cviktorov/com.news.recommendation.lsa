 shows how much you know about anything brakes 
sho very different inch i forget discs all around
vented front normal taurus setup smaller discs front 
drums rear

one i saw had vented rears tooit lot
 course sales man fooltitanium wheelsyeah right
 later told me were magnesiummore believable still
crap since al so m uch cheaper just good

i tend agree tho still doesnt take sho up standard
 running regular basis brakes should bigger like
 sotake look ones corradoswhere have
braking regulations

well lets seemy tbird sc has computercontrolled adjustable
suspension wheel abs disks vented front rear point

rears also vented

belts sturdy passenger compartment aerodynamics good enough 
nascar without too much change hp ftlb supercharged l v
wheel independent suspension plus limitedslip differential 
 top speed excess mph rides vrated tires i have yet
 find rs any other speed rating 

 up standard why 

james i really hate do try reading damn posts

 you shouldntve done try answering damn question
i am well aware fact mention sc
 

never tbird mentioned discussion about shos 
stangs being up spec i do know about tbirds i
only know specs quoted sho previous poster sounded
 little anemic me say up snuff does 
kn any way disencourage me from wishing own one nor does make 
 bad car merely means i think ford could have added extra
bit safety tossed larger brakes wheels plenty large
enough them fit memory serves right which may very well 
 motor plenty powerful enough need 

well my point sc sho both have very similar
characteristics front rear disks abs sho high output
v wheel independent suspension very good aerodynamics point
harness fat rubber mph top speed one them 
up standard i think sc other isnt 
why flamage just curiousity
