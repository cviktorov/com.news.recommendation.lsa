 matter interest does anyone know why autos so popular us while 
 here europe rare just wondering

 many our cities traffic signals every feet unsynchronised
 course well here ottawa anyway roads so congested 
shifting manually real pain left foot also most canadians 
too stupid learn how shift manually gee i gotta coordinate my two
feet clutch brake accelerator i gotta steer shift 
operate signals optional radio my two hands duh 

i agree wholeheartedly

cant done also most north american made cars come automatic 
 standard equipment so why bother manual when car can shift 
 you addition money

 sure about ca here us manuals quite often 
standard equipment course finding car one might hard 
 you read sticker window usally additional k 
so tacked lousy tranny so you actually paying more just
 its sometimes hard find one equipped standard 
applies most cars luxoyachtseg caddilac licolns etc
