wagon which i have heard somehow slightly faster than coupe

wagon has automatic its slower

could due rearend ratio also 

usually automatics have different rearends than manuals from
my limited experience anyways

youll have fun looking rearend gears shothe taurus
 frontwheeldrive vehicle

i went back checked article again sho wagon quicker
than sho automatic significantly slower than real sho

why anyone would order sho automatic transmission 
beyond me you cant handle stick you should stick 
regular taurus leave sho real drivers 
say arent real drivers who cant use stick eg
disabled persons arent any position use 
sho anyway 

i would willing bet we removed automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like l
mustangs camaros like wed cut down number 
accidents each year autos fine sedate little sedans
 have business performance cars imho
