 my honda accord just hit magic mile mark now
 all sorts things beginning go bad latest problem
 i am experiencing my brakes still stop 
 car fine once i am stopped completely my brake pedal
 sink another inches all itself feels really
 strange i am worried my brakes quit working one 
 days
 
 i checked my brake fluid reservoir full 
 fluid itself looked really dirty like dirty oil i called
 my mechanic he told me i need new brake master cylinder
 which cost me whopping 

you alone my honda accord miles started 
showing same behavior

i replaced brake master cylinder myself took about hour cost 
about sure beats paying have someone else do i wanted 
rebuild my own master cylinder instead putting rebuilt one would 
have cost only rebuild kit

 honda brake master cylinder easy get two bolts attach 
engine compartment two brake lines enter master cylinder tricky 
part brake lines were stuck tight my craftsmen open end wrench 
rounded off bolt heads i had use vise grips loosen those suckers 
wow best invention since sliced bread after very easy bolt 
 new part place add new brake fluid bleed brakes

 quite easy even beginner my local auto parts store had repair 
manual honda accord had detailed diagrams master brake 
cylinder stepbystep procedure replacing
