why anyone would order sho automatic transmission 
beyond me you cant handle stick you should stick 
regular taurus leave sho real drivers 
say arent real drivers who cant use stick eg
disabled persons arent any position use 
sho anyway 

i would willing bet we removed automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like l
mustangs camaros like wed cut down number 
accidents each year autos fine sedate little sedans
 have business performance cars imho

i have disagree i have z speed auto
w overdrive really better way chevy autos reknowned
 long life ability handle copious amount power i live 
 dallas area manual would much harder drive traffic 
here now i still lived out sticks like i used manual would 
more fun 

safetywise auto less distractingi would hate have 
shifting gears while i trying ease traffic freeways here
performancewise i can hold my own against any stock mustang 
camaro w five speed 

all imho 

all my hos disagree your hos i loved dallas rush hour my stick
detested autolike i did any other time auto course
dalls rush hours nothing from what i hearif i lived la i might
 different persuasion just record rarely do you shift
gears when merging trafficthat what speeds good forth 
good up through around most time so you can just wind out
its going hurt anything keeps powerband anyway
only shift top gear when you exceeding redline thfairly rare
unless you drive ferrari some id bet when you hit cruising 
speed where you feel comfortableor when my mother sitting 
passanger seat complaining about how you wind her poor little engine way
too hi 
just my hos
