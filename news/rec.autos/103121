im considering switching geico insurance have heard 
 do assign specific agent each policy claim i 
worried might real pain when you make claim i have
also heard try get rid you you have accident

dont worry about theyll drop you like hot potato after you do
 make claim theyll just make filing claim pain end
 when leave you lurch

ive read group geico has funded purchasing radar
guns police depts im sure where
more than geico funded company developed lidar when locals 
 showed reluctance buy units geico started giving them away i
 know theyve given units florida highway patrol county sheriffs 
 some local governments
 real question why hook geico other ins cos can
 tell which drivers represent risk determination can make
 after you receive speeding ticket from one geicos lidar units most
 drivers do represent increased risk even after ticket two 
 gives them opportunity raise rates equal risk its called
 extra profits also know how silly nsl how almost
 universally ignored driving excess nsl gets you ticket 
 increase your rates points your license doesnt make you
 riskier driver insure
like sound like people who thought up scheme go geico

unless you have some driving history problems youre usually better go
 one major companies stay youll get long term customer
discounts your premiums now about your premium paid 
commission thats another story another day
