 i heard diesels considered cleanerburning than
 gas engines because emit less carbon monoxide
 hydrocarbons oxides nitrogen co hc nox
 
 can put out lot particulate matter i heard
 something about legislation being discussed clean up
 diesel emissions anything works 
 install scrubbers diesels how about feasibility
 installing them trucks cars would any
 different than catylitic converter id assume easier
 since were removing particulate matter instead converting
 gasses lets hear peoples opinions

 really bugs me emissions diesels cleanest any vechicle
 considered so polluting banned passenger cars
 california what bunch crap diesel fuel choice 
 enviromental benefit europe while here its illegal same reason
 
 particulates nothing carbon just annoyance worst
 nothing beats diesel cycle efficiency emissions torque engine
 durability its also cheaper

diesels fall same emissions mythology alcohol fuels main reason
 considered cleaner because better emissions we
actually measure regulate also contribute additional emissions
which have long been determined harmful suitable control 
limits have been defined 

current evidence pointing most visible smog actually being diesel emissions
 suspended particles less photochemical reaction diesel particulates
 now becoming major concern decreased lung capacity alcohols emit
signifcantly more aldehydes known carcinigen than gasoline evidence
 mounting while we have been beating gasoline engine death we may
have been ignoring effects alternatives

 anyone who thinks diesels so great should go spend few hours 
rush hour traffic some cities europe stench diesels 
awful can even burn eyes 

diesels being clean only relative our current standards
