 you can avoid problems entirely installing oil drain valve 
 place bolt i have one both my cars have been 
 leaks miles combined miles both cars
 
 yes someone would have problem draining your oil parking lot
 
 all have do reach underneath turn valve forget trip 
 home
 less likelyhood have wrench them
 
 i personally recommend installing special locking drain plug keep
 vandals away

i worried about someone stealing my oil once also i finally 
decided just have my drain plug welded shut works great 
i figure when i add three four quarts when oil light
comes every month so its just good better than
 old wives tale changing oil filter every miles
works me i must say 


either ive just fallen you guys
 really paranoid

youre actually worried about somebody stealing 
your oil

cmon you think vandalll do 

thats absolutely ridiculous

besides how hard get under car 
change oil

i can say from experience cars ive driven 
changed oil my mazda pretty much pain 
once youve done once you dont forget how 
gets easier

i cant imagine any other cars much worse than mine
