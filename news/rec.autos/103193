get hold previous owner car got all maintanence
history car between instrument pannel 
 car has been replaced odometer also has been reset
 zero therefore true meter reading reading before
replacement plus current mileage shows mile difference

dealer never told me anything about important story

i hope i can return car full refund do u think 
 possible does anyone have similar experiences any comments
 appreciated thanks

something happened south africa about year ago dealer sold 
mercedes odometer reading k kilometers lady turned out 
 actual reading should have been k court case followed because
lady said she wouldnt have bought car much kms dealer found 
quilty fined had take back car

i think you have case you can get sworn statement from previous
owner take car back dealer threaten him something
