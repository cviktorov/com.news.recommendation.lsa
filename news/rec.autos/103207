 i normally have unloaded colt delta my glove box loaded
 magazine handy which perfectly legal oklahoma those
 times im travelling interstate i keep unloaded 
 sw magnum revolver glove box speedloader

 my pocket which legal everywhere under federal law illinois
 state police hanged

carrying pistol loaded unloaded glove compartment 
considered carrying concealed weapon colorado illegal without
 concealed weapons permit unless law has been changed recently
carrying weapon openly legal colorado concealing illegal
i read newspaper account last year where police stopped car 
traffic infraction observed magnum revolver sitting 
seat driver could cited possessing carrying weapon
because concealed article stated gun had
been discovered glove box would have been considered crime

carrying glove box coveredim sure what i 
thinking legal oklahoma 

 interstate travel long legal you own
 your point origination destination gun carried
 locked compartmentbox glove box specifically excluded separate
from ammo legal under title chapter section i
forget my copy regs home us code 
unfortunately has prevented theft state troopers 
certain state which shall remain nameless protect hopelessly
stupid under states law
