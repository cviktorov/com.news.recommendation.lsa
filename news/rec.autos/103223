 drain holes i know i used margine tub drain 
regretably i waited three months i short cash wouldnt fix 
under warrantee i paid dearly messed up my electrical system
including balancemotion sensor which located near fuel shutoff 
 trunk resulted my passive restraints malfunctioningthey would
 retract so i ended up paying about have sensor replaced 
 have tail lights resealed firts replaced hatch gasket
which i insisted problem so did charge me 
when i proved right mention water damage
