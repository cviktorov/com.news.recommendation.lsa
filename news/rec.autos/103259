here story i bought car about two weeks ago i finally can
get hold previous owner car got all maintanence
history car between instrument pannel 
 car has been replaced odometer also has been reset
 zero therefore true meter reading reading before
replacement plus current mileage shows mile difference
comparing mileage odometer disclosure from 
dealer never told me anything about important story

i hope i can return car full refund do u think 
 possible does anyone have similar experiences any comments
 appreciated thanks

 tricky situation previous owner didnt inform
 dealer odometer change previous owner committed
fraud he may liable dealer may also liable 
previous owner notified dealer previous owner had 
dash replaced dealer previous owner had dash changed 
legally any records search car should turn up fact 
 odometer had been altered dealer changes speedometer he has
 report goes cars service record manufacturer
 title i remember correctly dealer told me 
 old mileage etc were sent ford when my tbirds speedo 
 replaced odometer can set old mileage must 
 cant eg electricallydriven odometers mileage 
 old odometer must written permanent sticker which 
affixed door frame vehicle 

either way change had been done legally records search
which dealer almost certainly did should have turned up
