 can put out lot particulate matter i heard
something about legislation being discussed clean up
diesel emissions anything works 
install scrubbers diesels how about feasibility
 installing them trucks cars would any
different than catylitic converter id assume easier
since were removing particulate matter instead converting
gasses lets hear peoples opinions

 technology cummins applying diesels comply 
 newer ca emissions laws involves three things i know 

 all compliant diesels turbocharged
 all use aftercooler which cools air which heated
 compression turbocharger up about psi
 gismo injector pump which senses pressurized air
 intake limits full delivery fuel while pressure 
 low

 scrubbers catalytic converters etc used path from
 turbocharger exhaust outlet kept very free

interestingly except lowpressure fuel limitation power output 
 mileage enhanced measures one can buy aftermarket
turbos aftercoolers which generate more power lots more power
 approved carb
