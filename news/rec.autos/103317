 two crank configurations 
 flat most common one probably crank very
similar i crank

which flat engines have i style cranks

 comparing those two engines i 
flat have first order shaking forces rocking moments 
i has second order shaking force while flat has second
order rocking moment significant thing about flat s
second order moment can easily balanced out adding
mass ends crank i however requires counter
rotating shaft mass balance out second order forces

i am sure subaru porsche use boxer configuration
 inline crank you analyzed compared would you
care reevaluate other case flat four i think 
configuration perfectly balanced far primary secondary
forces couples concerned i have article front me
 says so

bottom line biggest difference between engines would probably
 intended use flat easier fit under low hoods
 rear compartments mid rear mounting i can 
mounted transversely reduce hood length read cab forward
other than isnt much fanfare differences between
them matter what subaru ads say technology shared 
porsche indeed

 flat four also shorter than inline so even mounted
longitudinally take up lots length longitudinal
placement easier wheel drive drivetrain

i think subarus ads hold water practice flat fours
 noticeably smoother than inline s completely buzz free
though some may like its peculiar note alfa has shown 
boxer four can produce spine tingling scream only likes 
recent hondas can approach
