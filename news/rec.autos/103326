 dont buy one best way avoid tickets
 i used have one whenever cop would pull me over see
 thing give me ticket one time my sister driving
 had glove compartment broken she
 got ticket i had received tickets because 
 one my sister so total five

 five years ago now i dont have one have 
 gotten ticket my driving habits have changed
 drastically only two days ago i going mph highway
 mph limit cop saw me i break little nothing
 happened i driving minivan my family 
 otherwise i have cutlass supreme which i do most 
 times highway

 so basically my opnion get one you do get pulled
 over cop hear your excuse you have radar
 detecter he again has been my experienc


just get remote model visible cop sure get
front rear sensors

you can also just put detector off side dash so cop
doesnt see right awayvalentine best detector far stated
 car driver even tells you what direction radar coming from
 also gives amount threats picking up so you go through
 same place everyday always goes off you can glance 
 number threats valentine detecting see genuine cop
 its about you can only get factory directone problem
