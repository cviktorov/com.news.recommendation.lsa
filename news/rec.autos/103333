 subject upcoming new mustang

i do put much stock mag rags inside information even
ford rep quotes taurus pretty much surprise when 
finally disclosed its entirety inside information had 
taurus v rearwheel drive one point i wouldnt look
 simple repaneled mustang folks you may cheating yourself
 you do theres lot potential ford hasnt released new
car without wheel years mustang project has been
brewing least right wheel could happen those
modular vs out too interest cafe 
competition dont rule those out either your ignorant you do
 so many spy shots artist renderings out 
who really knows what itll look like mach iii doubt 
highly

 next mustang fords highest profile car attracts
way more attention than camarofirebird because its heritage
 more embedded general public dont lie yourself 
believe ford forfeit 


 car magazines have printed lot information about new mustang
 consensus about what believe my car circle 
suspension pieces tuning almost identical current
cobra stiffer body structure which improve its behavior
after mn thunderbird cost weight debacle ford decided 
independent rear suspension rear wheel drive wont tried again 
 volume car 

 current l v soldier about two years version 
 valve modular v mark viii could offered ford
 spending big money tooling up l l v engines which 
power most cars immediate future therefore probably
do consider volume production hp v engines priority 

undisguised car looks ok nearly exciting new
camarofirebird imo 

i suspect ford produce car higher quality than gm 
achieve camaro firebird way gm loses money temptation
 just get them out door sake positive cash flow 
great once demand really takes off
