i have both camry each manual speed transmissions
 has about miles about miles about
 year ago i found master cylinder clutch 
leaking fluid around piston seal leading air system fluid
back passenger compartment car i pulled plunger 
got rebuild kit new plunger seal etc thought i had problem
licked much my surprise same problem developed several months
later time i looked carefully master cylinder make sure
 were scratches burrs other obvious causes problem i
didnt find any ever since i have been periodically feeding clutch
hydraulins additional fluid bleeding air from system i knew i
would selling car didnt want go all way solving 
problem

i should add clutch original ive had adjust 
pedal allow maximum extension piston master cylinder 
order actuate clutch

my hypothesis means when fully depressing clutch pedal
 angle piston rod attached pedal off axix 
cylinder thus cocking piston seal perhaps deforming 

what do you think explanation can you suggest possible fix
short replacing master cylinder getting new clutch put 

now same problem except above diagnosis doesnt explain
why all fluid leaked out way master cylinder 
passenger compartment while i vacation days during which
 clutch pedal depressed otherwise caused distort what
can you suggest here

many thanks lets hope i dont end up going click clack
