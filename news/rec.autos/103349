can anyone offer any opinions ford probe ala how do 
 long run repair records reliability mileage etc

some other owners fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented 
about problem i havent seen happen my month old 
 probe gt i think may something ford has corrected since 
 initial batch cars also someone said ford has issued 
service bulletin inform dealers about how correct problem so you 
may able get your dealer fix 

i have had my probe looked twice my local dealer where i purchased
 car first time made problem worse second time
after advising them service bulletin mentioned my fordprobe mailing
list said didnt know bulletin adjusted window 
made much better however now makes scritch scritch noise rough
roads still squeals when i openclose window wet weather anyone
elsess do 

ford only gives key car cmon ford spend extra few pennies

i got two keys my car only one remoteentry pushbutton thingie
 i bought my miles i think may have been 
repossession so im surprised something missing 

horn buttons behind air bag spokes center personal preference

i am seriously considering following advice owners manual where
 describes procedure follow you discover something your ford
 could cause serious injury threaten lives etc something
about notifying national traffic safety group well ford those little
youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons 
terrible

 latter probably because air bag its pretty much takes up
all space where youd expect find horn
speaking horn i surprised find probe comes one
 those nice merican sounding horns instead japanese sounding kind
 previous probes had japanese horns

well i guess thats good way way its bad when someone
hears kind horn expect see big american car may
 associate sound small jap car style car like probe 

tires fling dirtmud onto side car 
yeah very badly enough annoying sometimes

 mudflaps help lot

transmission speed must

i have always been speed guy almost every car ive ever owned has been
 speed because i got good deal car miles i
knowingly overlooked fact has automatic pretty
hightech automatic fully electronicaly controlled speed 
torque converter lockup even automatic im getting mpg 
highway driving course driving illegal so i 
probably made sentence up around town mileage has been
around bad automatic course doesnt have 
control speed since i do lot city driving turns out
 very convenient its nice able drink cup coffee 
drive same time although too illegal here

 shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still

shakes rattles has been my main gripe ive gotten them fix 
worst them i fear rather harsh ride car 
 virtual potpouri rattles when gets older

tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping k 

 my probe gl i got about k out original goodyears
 had driven replacement tires bridgestone k miles when
i tradeed car vr firestones my probe
look like theyre designed performance ie rather wide shallow
tread etc so probably wont last long car handles
very very very well sticks road like glue even rough
surface

interior very very nice too very pleasing eye ergonomically
sound

definitely fordmazda did very very nice job one 
car has much more expensive than actually look feel 

yes cars stiff suspension isnt everyone i personally like 
 you find little harsh otherwise like car id strongly
suggest looking mx

having driven probe years i find suspension interesting
 car actually drives much better than very firm
ride you definitely know about each every bump road yet
 car remains very civilized even bumpiest roads you hear 
feel bumps yet car retains its posture very well

 you have passengers all means bring them along too theyll find
 have room back youll find car rides
differently thats better up you 

well i wouldnt encourage passengercarrying probe unless 
person front seat likes sit his knees dash 
mentioned consumer reports writeups consider back seat
 parcel shelf biggie me though had been id 
have bought car its definitely family car

also theres lot glass
around you which i wasnt expecting temperature inside car gets pretty
hot summer

ac must any probe from particular sends out
 real blast cool air when ac max lots glass you
mentioned what gives car very good visibility reports you
see all writeups most sportssporty cars dont have 
good visibility

ive heard exhaust system has trouble mine works fine
i havent heard about one i know some very early probes
 maybe had problems prematurely rusting mufflers which

 complaints ive heard re exhaust system s have been 
 gt course being different engine differeent 
exhaust system

i one those who qualified free replacement
since i had already replaced muffler when i received notice 
i wasam due refund from ford i applied february am still
waiting 

gave me free rental car day half i without my
car i quite happy way handledespecially considering
 i expecting worst from them

yes i pretty amazed when i had my car some touchup
adjustments past week had keep overnight too busy
 them get offered pay rental 
did make me pay taxes insurance though 

from what ive heard sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems 
 probe probably mx when first went production 
i think problems have mostly been corrected point thats
almost always expected completely new car like though

i have agree seem have some qc problesm i seriously
feel car design sound expect do very well
