after too many years school im finally graduating getting real
job course i am trying make plans how spend all extra
money right now i have accord good car real sporty 
i thinking selling about two years dropping around
k sports car some kind after thinking about i may have 
better idea ill keep accord until drops buy car ive
always wanted corvette stingray my reasoning accord
 corvette less than what i would spend anyway

basically im thinking late s early s around k
my question what good years consider reliability looks
horsepower order believe horsepower main
concern i want go fast i get my motorcycle what 
good prices

 vettes had same basic chassis add aluminum weaker 
rear axle housing all years used same brakes similar springs etc
 late s bad year gm reliability catastrophic converter 
added 

cheapest corvette low end about k tops out about k except 
 those morooons think indy th aniversity vette 
special guys have been known ask k i dont think get 


best buy convertables i got my k needs body work 
im willing 

parts all readily avail swap meets mail order etc

v reliability looks independant suspension wheel disk all 
under k thought miata good deal

also what would insurance look like im male single i might
wait until im get car lower insurance would fact 
i mainly drive other car lower some type classic
car rarely driven insurance class driving under k miles
per year

 my dad has vette its what you say classic insurance
 basically what means has restricted amount driving
 time which basically means cant used every day car would
 probably suit your needs limited mileage

my origional inquires my insurance agent i can drive my convertable 
 miles less per year i must keep locked garage 
 cost me stated value per year does sound right

 
ive also been looking vettes recently found convertible
 i like dealer i currently own ford escort gt which
 insured through state farm i called em up asked about rates
 
 i sell escort vette insurance per months
 
 i keep escort vette insurance per months 
escorts insurance goes down approx per months
 
im male have good driver discount another variable would
 where you live best bet just call up some insurance brokers
 get quote
 
state farm says base price fair market value car
which determined outside apprasier look newspaper
 call up dealers find out what going rate adjust 
 condition car
 
 get values above went selling price car 
dealers asking price i need do research find out 
 reasonable any case i told state farm value k

get appraiser look car he check serial numbers look 
 origional equipe depending what mods have been done car could 
 worth only k problems like wrong engine trans wrong paint type 
vetts used lacquer modification would reduce tthe value your 
looking car drive right

 sounds like ball park price smallblock cu manual 
 air car would put closer k

get appraised insurance purposes also
