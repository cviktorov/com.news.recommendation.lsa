review ford taurus sho gene kim


background

 last week i bought ford taurus sho moving up from driving
 toyota celica st oldsmobile cutlass i have been
interested buying sho about five months have been combing
 classifieds denver chicago every week i bought 
remarkably clean maroonred sho k miles 
 far i can tell about under blue book i still
have another miles before extended service plan runs out

 one should any pre shos i made sure car 
already refit upgraded clutch pressure plate well 
having been recalled upgraded rotors seatbelt attachments
however my sho does have newer rod shifter i understand i
can get from any ford service center addition 
car received full tuneup k miles receiving new platinum
plugs valve adjustment

 car k miles car virtually immaculate
 clearcoat paint job devoid any large chips dents
although front airdammolding covered lots small
scratches surprising since most miles were spent 
highway

 having driven smaller twodoor coupe so long i bit
concerned about whether i could get used driving larger car 
my surprise size car doesnt bother me all seems
just nimble my celica comparisons my oldsmobile 
visibility from drivers seat excellent helped mostly 
 small quarterwindows aft backseat door windows 
 front cpillar rear window parallel parking bit
more difficult other than i love size

 fact im starting appreciate large trunk i pack up
 hour drive washington dc summer more 
ride later review


engine
 
 anyone even slightly interested shos i very
interested valve l yamaha shogun engine i 
disappointed base performance engine under rpms 
good you can even do reasonable launches from second gear although
i dont make practice engine revs smoothly eagerly
 tooling around town does require many shifts good
since shifter definitely one weakest points car
more later

 while performance engine under rpms may 
unremarkable undergoes jekyllhyde transformation once you hit
higher revs rpms butterfly valve opens you can
literally hear feel geometry engine changing twelve
more valves open up engine soars its rpm redline 
you treated my opinion sweetest sounding v around
 engine inexplicably sounds overjoyed rpm

 ive noticed when i drive around town i constantly watch 
tach see how far below rpm i am go from rpm 
you may have punch accelerator while torque more than
adequate doesnt come fully online until those other valves
 used


transmission

 when car driver first reviewed car 
marvelled how ford had put wimpy clutch balky shifter
 car i remember driving friends parents sho 
remember thinking about whether i had leg strength drive 
car traffic clutch stiff back 

 entire clutch assembly my sho has been replaced under 
ford recall clutch sho feels stiffer than 
one my toyota celica fact friction point seems bit
larger more forgiving

 when playing shifter car parked shifter
felt very reasonable gates were where youd expect
 shifting action smooth road its
much same you have shift slowly make mistake its
 clumsy shifter

 when hurrying shifts like when i initially trying impress
friends i consistently miss shift often grope clumsily 
 shift sometimes even muff shift i find 
pretty amazing car like 

 also took me several days realize you get smoothest
shifts when you take your time seems obvious compared my
toyota my friends honda seems atrocious clumsy
someone recautos noted crxs should blow shos offtheline
because incredibly clumsy shifter

 i now shift much more sedately shifter seems more
reasonable when you play within bounds shifter works
smoothly surprises i dont know whether rod shifter
upgrade would help all

 along same lines i initially had trouble shifting gears
smoothly again slowing down shifts taking more care 
match revs when letting out clutch helped immensely took
several days me get hang i think some my problems
were because ive never had car enough power balk bad
shifts higher gears

 occasionally i have trouble shifting reverse shifter
refuses enter gate i often grind synchros trying 
get gear ill watching carefully next couple
 months

 quirk when i upshift engine drops back 
rpm i hear whirring grinding noise coming from 
engine compartment terribly loud passenger can
definitely hear i asked about when i looking car
 do all my passengers apparently definitely sho
sound gearbox apparently called gear rollover
replies my queries recautos end review


exterior

 i mentioned before i am astounded how well body 
sho has stood up paint chipping front bumper grille 
virtually nonexistent looking how older tauri sometimes
dont age so gracefully i wonder what guys ford did
differently sho bodies

 body my opinion extremely attractive matching
color body moldings than stock tauri some odd reason 
sho seems different enough from vanilla tauri get stares 
stoplights course could my overactive imagination
 shos get fog lights more open grille completely
monochromatic exterior deeper ground skirt back 
sho stenciled relief ive seen couple shos whose owners have
colored florescent colors black yuck

 i dont think car flashy i like way i feel
almost anonymous all those tauri out different 
distinctive enough those us who care 


interior

 interior what really makes me feel like i dont deserve 
car seats grey leather steering wheel shifter 
covered black leather entire instrument panel done 
 blackgreymetallic scheme 

 instrumentation stock taurus except mph speedo
 rpm tach you get center console two cupholders 
large compartment under radio great cd player armrest
 contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coin
holders tollways i think compartment holding
cassette tapes theres mapholders doors oddly small
glove compartment

 i spilled whole can coke cupholder delighted
 find entire rubber holder can removed washed 
sink hey im really impressed ergonomics 
thoughtfulness went its design its before 
interior upgraded

 backseat bigger than any car ive had why do need so
much space smartass comments please 

 driver passenger seat have lumbar side bolsters from
what i hear its uncommon side bolsters show wear
mine exception left side bolster drivers has
cracked im convinced right bolster inflating all 
way

 big surprise me i forgot shos dont have normal
hand parking brake instead have regular parking brake 
you press your left foot too bad again im getting used 
 seems bit anachronistic me


ride

 suspension nice stiff too stiff its stiffer than
any car ive had friends new toyota celica st seems tauter
 still able soak up bumps better sho seems stiffer 
less ability soak up bumps driving over railroad tracks 
noisy jarring affair other hand taking turns feels
wonderful because body so rigid doesnt flex all i
listened before i bought car

 highway ride great when i drove car from
chicago back purdue i had trouble keeping under mph let alone
from trying see what mph really feels like its relatively
quiet ride sunroof rattles ive tried find out what
exactly makes all noise up seems window
 rests rails easy way get rid i think

 over past three days ive oscillated between thinking 
suspension wonderful perfect thinking ride way
too rough me mind you i wonder whether i would
advise my dad buy one himself ive discovered 
 shifter you take your time shifts youll have reason
 complain let me explain

 ride worst when turning applying lots power 
wheels i feel wheels scrabbling traction torque steer
making car skitter left right after i understood i
avoid limits traction im happy camper again

 its body rigidity composure car

 matching suspension steering feel quite heavy
my first impression driving my sho how hard you had turn 
wheel highway speeds tracks straight arrow when
driving around parking lot higheffort steering didnt seem so
useful however its reasonable doesnt communicate road
 driver well ford probe gt imho its much better
than steering my celica st

 i wonder how bad car during winter


miscellaneous notes

 gripes

 rattles from sunroof intermittent some days rattles
 loudly other days i look up wondering where all noise went

 activating sunroof sometimes very noisy loud squealing 
 retracts its rails i wonder quick fix 
again other days completely disappears function humidity

 once i made connection between sometimes awful feeling suspension
 torque steer ive never complained about ride

 i wish seats had more support under thighs also i wish 
side bolsters would close more tightly 

 i hear tires car can get really expensive i
currently have goodyear gts cost previous owner 
 four

 i used hate ford stereo systems whose idea 
 use volume paddle now my amazement i dont
really mind sometimes think its okay idea
pretty ridiculous though

 getting up rpm sometimes seems chore 
 big deal more than enough torque
down low

 i often goof up shifting when driving friends 
took me couple days before i could really shift
smoothly from nd rd gear hard believe isnt 

 my car has almost miles my parents noted 
 almost impossible find lowmileage sho 
astute observation imho i wonder how long i can make
my sho last i just bought book titled drive forever
 tips department 

 goofy parking brake pedal still throws me loop i once
parked car gear accidentally let out clutch
after i started car jolted forward bounced off
 car front me paint damage all starting car 
 whole new ritual me fangled pedal also i began 
 wonder how strong brake really today i backed out 
parking spot today started drive away before i noticed 
 glowing brake light oops

 drivers power window creaks when closed all way same
 thing happens my parents mercury sable oddly all 
other windows work smoothly


 likes

 im liking interior amenities more more each day 
 cupholders great

 i didnt expect use keyless entry buttons so much 
 really handy you can lock all doors 
pressing buttons together neat 
you can never lock yourself out car

 i really feel like i dont deserve car i really cant
believe i could afford i got car ten years 
ahead schedule 

 i love car so much ive been telling my parents 
look buying one i love car so much i
wrote k file i meant write couple lines
 ended up 

 were jd powers survey used car owners i would have
 opportunity express my incredible satisfaction owning 
car i dont like thinking about getting another car 
point time im sure id buy another sho under you
cant beat next time airbag abs though

 insurancewise car also big win i pay same premiums
 my toyota celica despite has nearly twice
 horsepower 



other odds ends

 much my amazement sho mailing list anywhere
maybe because sho registry publication has filled void i
havent joined yet ive noticed queries about shos still
appear recautos about once month owners shos always
quick respond very vocal fans cars maybe some
 most vocal recautos 

 ive put together responses my questions about cars 
well other posts useful information cars ill 
posting form faq soon 

 anyone interested starting mailing list please speak up
i dont know i have resources here purdue start one 
maybe someone out does
