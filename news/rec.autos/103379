i dont think its so easy tell from any other series unless
you look real close i really do think volvos all dogs though beacuse 
 agricultural 

while previous volvos have been essentially very fast tractors series
 far from agricultural design execution how many fwd tractors have you 
seen

have godlier than thou advertising 

you state like bad thing remember car companies use
ad agencies dont do own ads

 part renault

 true i know had done joint ventures renault i havent
heard about subsumption renault does mean french government
now owns volvo anyway renault makes some very nice cars just dont sell
em n america


however one thing i do think favour 
immediately recognisable volvo something you can say
about most japanese manufacturers ford saab also have strong corparate
look which like what i thing all car makers could aim 
make life little more varied
