 converter lock up nd rd th gears

dont forget now new speed manual trannys available drive
train more optimally geared get most out engine

rare so speed autos very real

bottom line both manuals automatics have vastly improved

i think automatics have advanced far more than manuals
especially shift intelligence i say smart automatic 
better than majority drivers terms being right
gear right time which me more important than torque
converter losses

i prefer stick fun auto traffic

shifter easily facilitate manual clutchless shifts i am
referring much copied mercedes jagged gate only
department where you lose out number ratios available
 course converter losses

 ayrton senna can drive racecar fully automatic transmission
