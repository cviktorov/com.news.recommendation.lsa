 quality autobahns something myth road surface
isnt much different typical tx freeway better
 terms lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc

 light highways texas funny everywhere else ive been
 only light em junctions

sorry i meant autobahns us freeways


i wont even get how much road markings vary between states 
localities except say some areas where markings 
essentially nonexistant

than most roads here dip asphalt you test your
shocks kill you dont get me wrong i love 

 would have quite severe i dont recall any us freeway
without road damage warnings i would regard unsafe
 any decent well damped car

i suspect you have very limited experience us freeways vary
dramatically particularly between states i can name number 
interstate highways various parts country where would 
very optimistic any car

well ive driven every state alaska drive about k per year
i take long cross country trips any chance i get its fun me i
can get reimbursment
my job allows me drive rather than fly labor point 
ive driven just about every freewayin us germany uk france plus
some mexico which surpisingly good


im sure what you call quite severe terms road deviations
 i suspect every single bridge junction i through ct would 
considered so theyre hard take mph thats only
interstate ive seen deviations its one i drive
frequently

yes age total freeway us 
all you have do case mark hazard advising people 
slow so 


texas pretty much edgecase you cant assume everywhere
has roads good condition flat terrain 

texas freeways varied sometimes good surface mostly flat 
i ca comparable hilly

wideopen spaces just aint so

given absence other traffic car built eg 
most us freeways just fine problem other road users 
cops
