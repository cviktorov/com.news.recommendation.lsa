couldnt stay together i would say everyone have 
problems i had know its just car 
ability get car fixed which happen any
chryslerdodgetake your pick dealer i dont care going 
reform dealersservice intro lh cars i believe
 when i see case point local dodge dealer you drive up
just looking you dont even get out your door when about yes 
salesman all eye you like next meal literally pounce you
 try get you make deal everything your eye wanders towards
service about times worse than i had alignment problem 
 tried tell me k frame bent about dollars 
workparts fix let me tell you problems i had i took care
 car i put alot miles first couple years took
 every checkup needed many shouldnt have been

 dodge shadow es

 were replaced within years i owned car

engine 
 alternators
rear suspension torsion bar
 water pumps
 thermostats
hall effect sensor
main computer
 batteries

 were rebuiltrepaired

radiator
automatic transmission
power steering


those just things i can remember off top my head 
about year before i sold car i said myself its good car i
just cant find anybody competent enough fix end before i
traded saturn power steering started acting up again i
just stopped putting money i must have put least 
worth repairs over its lifetime i am sorry lee iacocca can bite
me bullshit whoever backs em best just afraid stupid things 
going fall apart one buy them without assurance why 
hell do you think lh has been nicknamed last hope

you can do better i know people disagree me here 
japanese like honda toyota only american car company i
feel quality product saturn i touch another chrysler
product again way i dont care how good lh cars look good i
 admit look promising support you get gm
isnt much better thank god dont control saturn like do
 divisions would just another marketing ploy 

dont get me wrong i watching my car which i do like like 
hawk next years i am much more hesitant say any car
 really good until has proved itself me

 since someone else pointed out cd source i note because
i used read magazines car driver has never had good
thing say about most chrysler products shadow one always were
 moaning about reguritated kcar engine whereas motor trend
always thought were great cars car magazine really objective

 although alot people who dont like consumers reports i
 use them reinforce my argument i already know about big stink
 saturn crash tests time tell how good car 
shadowsundance rate much worse than average fact none 
chryslers rate better than average i think best one just
average excluding diamond starmitsubishi stuff lhs you
can find bad stuff about shadow try i might when i researched
 saturn i could find anything bad about great deal
 information about company just because new american
company has created quite stir automotive community 
good reason much more than introduction any new model lines 
any established company i read article which had subcolumn i
think imprinted me more than anything else some big wig 
toyota said i quote we watching them very closely come 
everybody grow up foreign cars especially japanese have been
kicking our butts good reason american car companies could make
 good product support customer way want days 
set ways which one reasons saturn created 
 still struggling because havent learned yet have 
ability workers inferior technology out date
 attitude just finding out its called
competition gentlemanwomen you dont satisfy demand 
consumer well your out
