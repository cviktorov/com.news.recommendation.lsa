now now before we get too carried away here

keep mind owning any car korea luxury only ruling
class can afford every government agency worth its salt finds some reason
 levy tax car ownership last i heard were seven different
fees pay own car i believe sort petty bureaucratic
inefficiency new president kim young sam wants eradicate basically
i think rules came place bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds
wanted wreak revenge ruling class exchange zaibatsus like
hyundai screwed over smaller companies perpetuating vicious cycle
i have faith korean people can potentially build cars well anyone
else now hyundai cars seem reflect tensions within society
 screwy components wont work together stubborn like mule 
car either wont go forward wont stop all

hahahahahaha gasp pant hm im sure whether above
 just silly remark serious remark case 
some misconceptions i think henry robertson hasnt updated his data
file korea sincemid s owning car korea longer
 luxury most middle class people korea can afford car do
have least one car problem korea especially seoul 
 just so many privatelyowned cars well taxis 
buses rushhour has become hour phenomenon 
 place park last time i heard back january kim administration
wanted legislate law requireing potential car owner provide
his her own parking area just like do japan

also henry would glad know hyundai isnt only
car manufacturer korea daewoo has always manufactured cars 
i believe kia back business well imported cars 
mercury sable becoming quite popular well though still
quite expensive

finally please ignore henrys posting about korean politics
 bureaucracy hes quite uninformed
