hi 
ive recently been toying idea purchasing old going
rate seems about cars anywhere from k mi
my question what should i expect price should i expect 
have extensive body work done what about engine transmission should i
likewise expect have both virtually replaced along those lines
does anyone have names addresses any mailorder parts
suppliers everything from engine body parts im completely new
 area restoring cars i dont actually do any work 
cars most work would have professionally done what sould
i expect cost upgrading rustfree mechanically
sound automobile
thanks advance

true enthusiasts able give you better answer 
 ill dump my impressions ive wanted own about years
now came close once i ended up buying fiero instead biggest mistake
 my life

anyway you should able get nice car your also set
 price range get taken nice looker pile shit
 most common total failure car would frame rust between 
engine passenger compartment also look chassis welded together
here oh yeah price range you talking about must banger
 you could find one would mucho more bucks

parts engine pretty easy come old car you
can even locate crude jc whitney catalog you have too

 machine itself pretty simple use spare tire windshild
washer instead pump fer chris sake so getting fixed good
bugporsche mechanic would easy since midengine you may spend
more labor any mechanical work
