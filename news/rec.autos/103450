its been while since ive reviewed car today i paid visit
 old friend whose love audis has been so overwhelming he
makes too sucessful living selling them

without further delay i get audi s


 servotronic steering

 those who familiar what servotronic 
name speed variable power steering manufactured zf 
used audis bmws

i have been outspoken my damming servotronic over past
couple months based magazine reviews drives 
 audi cs quattro audi cs fwd i am quite happy 
report now s servotronic inoffensive i
suppose due fat gumball tires servotronic has been
loaded up more so far has been best implementation 
i have tried far from perfect mind you id much
happier option i could refuse s i 
longer consider bad enough where i feel entire car 
ruined

 steering still tad too light accurate i
suppose stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information 
some makes through drivers hands so feel 
 accuracy ss steering also room 
improvement i consider ss steering better than 
japanese competition primarily because japanese do believe 
feel engineer out completely


 engine

wheee what pressure cooker just miles clock i did
 expect s producing anywhere close what 
putting out miles later still car packs terrific
punch turbocharged machine very unusual 
encourages lazy driving ie low revs high gear so
supremely flexible one could hardly believe theres only 
liters displacement move pound car around 
fashion maximum torque available rpm rpm
redline car can pretty much left third all day which
translates speed range something like mph 
chracteristic one normally associates large capacity vs
 technical achievement breadthtaking

throttle response right up good atmospheric engine 
fact would even put peaky multivalve engines shame downshifts
 almost unnecessary more fun use overboost feature
than rev engine those familiar s engine features
up seconds additional turbo boost passing sort like
lighting up after burners jet fighter one could 
right foot only third gear blast car from just 
few moments simply flooring gas far numbers go
maximum torque available overboost mode shoots up about lb
ft incredible liter takes few moments 
develop overboost well worth waiting since quite
 heavy car ones body parts flung around like say corrado
vr acceleration smooth strong somewhat similar riding
 jetliner accelerates down runway takeoff also one
 treated very distinctive entertaining whistle from 
turbo only entertaining sound come out very
refined bland sounding banger

yes audi has refined point where rpm sounds 
serene does smoothness outstanding quite
up standards very good eg valve bmw id say 
 terms refinement ie willingness rev smoothness lack 
harshness under full acceleration better than many vs however
lost refinement process characteristic cylinder bark
 made older engines so characterful terribly refined
 valve turbo sounds pretty bland except whistle under
full boost subjectively id rate vw vr engine being far more
musical than turbo also audis own v also far more musical
 rorty race car growl when pressed though none can
match its grunt

 only hint engines true capacity occurs when one taking
off from rest after turbo has come near stop extra
inertia from permanently engaged wd system one has somewhat
delicate feeding clutch prevent embarassing stall 
alternately one could use more revs both cases very small price
 pay fantastic engine i think audi america should
offer automatic option car just offer though 
extremely small numbers speed much peakier v 
characteristics engine perfect automatic ironically
 europe slush available none offered land 
slush marketing twits rearing ugly heads again


 chassis

ive noticed audis tend have very wide wheels relatively
modest tire widths car comes firestones size zr
which uncommon all however very attractive spoke
wheels less than inches wide so sidewall bulge
whatsoever combined flared wheel arches s has mouth
watering macho yet subdued look 

 rough concrete becomes immediately clear new body
style has made significant advances structural rigidity well 
road noise suppression i suppose two interrelated i
digress use cliche ss body feels like has been carved
out stone flex totally undetectable even when going over rough
roads super rigid body like stiff springs stiff dampers
do cause excessive harshness while ss ride quality 
never worry lexus also draw comparisons trucks 
pony cars

 servotronic steering has already been mentioned i consider 
 inoffensive because did inhibit spirited cornering i 
able test cars cornering powers without too much trepidation i
think new concept work car its fat gumball tires
talking about understeer oversteer practically meaningless 
banked highway ramp i went slow started applying power i
went around i could feel g forces build point where 
skin my face being tugged sideways yet car totally 
completely obedient throttle steering inputs felt 
limits were even close being approached g forces were
thrilling entire affair going around curve strangely
uninvolving you tell car what you want does end 
story i think i am starting relate more more those
reviewers who were highly impressed honda nsxs clinical
efficiency were unable fall love car

 brakes have very good firmness them stop car pretty
well too though ive read prone fade i am too
surprised since s does have uprated brakes over base audi
 fwd harder pads would help turn would lead more
wooden response when cold i am starting see trend among 
luxurysports sedan makers where extra weight being offset 
additional braking capacity lss fade performance nothing 
brag about neither qs legends brake fade days
seem forgotten virtue when everybodys attention focused 
antilock capability


 comfort

 car sporty abilities its comfort levels also
excellent cabin beautifully appointed carbonfiber panel
inserts place wood trim s all expected
gizmos heated seats power seats seat memory power 
 glaring ommision trip computer which removed
because audi hasnt gotten work reliably yet means 
car has boost gauge real disappointment taking account how
much turbo dominates its performance 

unusual germans s comes honda style moonroof 
well very intelligent dialasunroofposition rotary switch

noise levels including engine tire noise so low i wouldnt
consider lexus advantage area significant enough
 sway potential buyer


 conclusion

even though few able afford audi s its sticker price
 k car bargain one takes account what has 
offer over competition valve turbo real gem even 
 doesnt produce ferrari sounds other luxurysports sedan maker
offers utter security quattro all wheel drive which some 
worth extra money all itself safety features also 
top notch side impact standard compliant very elegant 
automatic seat belt tensioners dual airbags series
audis have been outstanding government crash tests gets my
thumbs up being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being
all out exciting intoxicating
