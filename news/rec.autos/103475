carrying pistol loaded unloaded glove compartment 
considered carrying concealed weapon colorado illegal without
 concealed weapons permit unless law has been changed recently
carrying weapon openly legal colorado concealing illegal
i read newspaper account last year where police stopped car 
traffic infraction observed magnum revolver sitting 
seat driver could cited possessing carrying weapon
because concealed article stated gun had
been discovered glove box would have been considered crime
