 dealer make money off you three ways you let him

 new car markup over his cost remember his holdback
 arranging financing through dealership 
 screwing you trade

keep deal dealer simple eliminating buying car 
dealers cost meaningless he makes trade andor gets 
kickback from bank

blue book you need know youre talking average wholesale average 
retail good guide value car you selling yourself 
try get average retail chances youll have done ok

 careful selling acquaintances you ever want them become friends
