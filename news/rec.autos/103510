 single transverse leaf spring front looked good 
limited performer

cc engine were available two fourdoor coupes station wagon
 sport coupe known europe manta same time 
were two series cars which sold very few numbers also had 
engine kadett suspension sport coupe model also
available rallye r blacked out hood tach fog lights
 mechanically same except numerically higher rear end ratio

 sport coupe also named manta us last
year gt any country both because us bumper height regulations
