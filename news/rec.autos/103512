new series mercedes benz wagon
particularly i would like hear about power manual t only
any comparisons between saab line mercedes would helpful

 manual transmission must have mb te 
 running you cannot get manual transmission car north
america seems buyers here maybe more accurately 
distributors interested manual trannies

 line comes hp engine all earlier years hp
i have e mere hp auto tranny i find 
 has sufficient power any normal driving situation more always
nice i cant complain

i test drove saab cse last fall here my impressions

 awesome power especially over rpm when turbo really comes 
 you get power really hard tight corner frontwheel
 drive causes understeer heavily viciously hook 
 corner desirable handling trait common powerful
 front drive cars cse hp mercedes reardrive so 
 does have problem
 huge interior cargo space
 most rubbery shifter i have ever encountered i drove spd 
 absolutely numb you might able get used i dont know
 i also didnt like its location which too far down too far right
 from shifters position i got impression saab really designed
 car automatic
 rather noisy engine buzz rattles creaks mercedes does
 exhibit characteristics
