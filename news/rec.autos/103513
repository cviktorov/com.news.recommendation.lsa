i am process buying new auto i havent decided yet whether
i should sell my current car myself trade part new
auto purchase

traditional wisdom says you almost certainly better off selling 
yourself you dont mind extra hassle having tradein purchase
just makes getting best price from dealership more confusing

i know blue book value car 

i assume retail bluebook two bluebook prices one 
retail one wholesale you really want retail price you can 
get blue books also have adjustments you can make low mileage
 extras your particular car you should look all stuff up yourself
also keep mind blue book prices averages over country
 may apply your area example blue book prices low 
california better way finding out how much your car might worth 
 call around see what its selling any used lots have one 
looking local papers similar cars checking out prices 
might more time efficient take small loss rather than hold out 
 months best price

 acquaintence
has offered give me blue book value car

i dont know what you mean acquaintance i would make darn sure
 i paid cashiers check full before delivery theres
 real temptation when selling pseudofriend more accomodating
than you should make sure you get money hedge about paying
 full start cashiers check cash i would go
elsewhere rememeber you can probably sell your car used car lot
 wholesaler get wholesale bluebook thats probably safer approach
than selling private party
