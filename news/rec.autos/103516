could someone explain how make sense drag coefficients ie cd mentioned magazines i understand lower numbers signify better aerodynamics 
what does mean real world way calculate new top speedsassuming car rev limited top speed mileage benefits identical car had cd reduced from 


 i dont remember formulas off hand has been awhile since
i took aerodynamics havent used stuff since 
 cd related drag force which what effects top speed 
fuel consumption when drag force car aircraft greater
than what vehicles engine can overcome has reached its top speed
autos course also have overcome rolling resistance
since drag opposes vehicles motion engine must make up 
 burning more fuel anyway since geometery auto rather
complex dragpressure coeffiecentetc either found experimentaly 
using numerical method

anyway flow around cylinder drag coeff 

 cd dqr

 where d drag force q flow velocity r radius
 clyinder
 get rough very rough estimate you can set r cars
width q cars speed knowing cd find drag force 
 car would need overcome
