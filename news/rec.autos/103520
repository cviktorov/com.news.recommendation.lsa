 based my experience fj hardtop jeepstyle model i 
 would definitely give new model consideration i were market 
 older models very well built unless toyota lost its mind i would
 assume until proven otherwise newer models have inherited some
 all qualities ancestors
 
 two major differences running gear im aware need study
 my has solid front axle housing whereas newer models have
 independant front suspension solid axle theoretically stronger 


 new cruisers do have independent suspension front 
still
run straight axle coils runner one 
independent
front cruisers have incredible wheel travel system 

 more reliable than newer model only experience tell 
 independant front suspension doubt compromise made satisfy
 typical user who never need real utility vehicle second
 difference type transfer case used newer models im
 sure i think tioyota went fulltime wd allwheel drive
 system older landcruisers have lockup type both have 
 advantages disadvantages
 
 up cruiser does have full time wd center diff locks 
low range my brother has incredibly sturdy vehicle which
has done all trails moab without tow later even
better bigger engine locking diffs
