 anyone else experiencing similar problem
 
 concerns clutch honda accord speed when clutch
 first used morning about first miles shifting 
 significant amount clutch chatter until things warm up 
 clutch shifts smoothly chatter started when i moved san 
 francisco bay area from lowhumidity environment dealer stated
 known happen since honda changed from asbestos 
 nonasbestos clutch material remedy seems moisture clutch
 surface causes slipping until moisture evaporates
 
 any comments out 

 clutch my honda civic exv ex us does too
its annoying now i think about worse when humidity 
high dealer also claims theres nothing can do since clutch 
 selfadjusting hydraulic design yeah right


one reasons i sold my civic vx chatterygrabby clutch
although i dint notice being any worse humid weather perhaps because
its always humid around here i told honda has do 
changing from asbestos nonasbestos linings which began around 
someone could make some good money selling oldfashion variety its
legal manufacture them days my feeling since many other
car makers do have problem its poor design engineering
problem part honda three things look out all honda
products clutch chatter bad brake rotors rusty exhaust systems
