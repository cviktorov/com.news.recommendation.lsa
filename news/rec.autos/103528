 i heard diesels considered cleanerburning than
 gas engines because emit less carbon monoxide
 hydrocarbons oxides nitrogen co hc nox
 
 can put out lot particulate matter i heard
 something about legislation being discussed clean up
 diesel emissions anything works 
 install scrubbers diesels how about feasibility
 installing them trucks cars would any
 different than catylitic converter id assume easier
 since were removing particulate matter instead converting
 gasses lets hear peoples opinions
 

vw mercedes have tinkered particulate traps also vw
uses kind turbocharger jetta ecodiesel helps
reduce particulates well although i dont know 
mechanics 

many diesel carsbusses trucks europe now being
equipped catalysts traps effort clean up
diesel emissions already well below legal limits anyway

its shame gm had soil diesels reputation 
passenger cars prevent further resource devotion 
research making outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead gas engines emissions
