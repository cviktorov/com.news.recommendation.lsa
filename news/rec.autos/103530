could someone explain how make sense drag coefficients ie cd mentioned magazines i understand lower numbers signify better aerodynamics 
what does mean real world way calculate new top speedsassuming car rev limited top speed mileage benefits identical car had cd reduced from 

its pretty complex cd isnt whole story either cd cars 
usually calculated based frontal area car so large car
 good cd could get same drag force smaller car 
poorer cd 

 calculate drag use formula

d rho v cd s

where d drag force lbs rho local air density slugsft
v velocity fts s frontal area ft note 
pieces called rho v sometimes called qbar dynamic pressure
 fancy aero term air pressure force 

note power 

p f v

where p power lbffts f force drag case lbf v
 velocity fts 

note you put whole equation one substituting d 
force you get velocity cubed term thats why huge increases power
result little increases speed ditto decreases cd 

so you have mph car reduce cd from your new top
speed sound trumpet fanfare

 mph

sorry dissappoint
