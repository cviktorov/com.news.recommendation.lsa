 hello auto enthusiasts
 
 i recently had more car mangled broken decided 
 get alarm installed its viper has shock
 sensor sensors each door ignition cutoff automatic
 door locks

i have same alarm installed my syclone works great shock
sensor very sensitive much more practical than motion sensor i have
 my other car doesnt trigger car rocked gently wind
 any kind shock sets off even kicking tire sets off 
works great

 
 what worries me hood hatch someone could pry 
 them up gently enough could bypass alarm

 shock sensor adjustable two cycles you can adjust
 sensitive enough way you could open hood without
setting off alarm although i know you cannot pop hood 
syclone without setting off my alarm now yet i have had zero none false
alarms system alarm tells you when you disarm whether has
been activated your absence i have been able trace every alarm its
cause false alarm
 
 im also wondering how easy would thief crawl
 underneath car cut battery cable disable alarm
 
i guess would possible depending vehicle my syclone so tight
 engine compartment would tough do 
supplemental power supplies you can put viper alarm i dont
have one i really think someone wants my car bad alarm
wont keep them from even supplemental power supply

 viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor 
 supposedly detects people approcahing car
 
 primarily convertibles i have convertible have looked 
 feature detail alpine actually makes better radar unit you want
 get one has zones can shut down independently so
 one side your car has pedestrian traffic something else 
would trigger alarm shuts down zone rather pulls tighter
i dont see real benefit unless you have convertible you
leave top down 

avoid voice alarm can added radar package talks 
people walk i saw one installed lotus esprit kids would
taunt seeing how close could get before warned them get back 
 owner finally disabled which defeats purpose my mind
 
 im interested opinions you netters about problems
 about viper general
 
i am real happy my viper one other feature i really like you can tune
 your preferences you can have arm passively you can disable
 chirp armingdisarming you can have lockunlock doors when 
alarm armeddisarmed 

i like features i hate chirp when alarm armsdisarms so mine
flashes lights only i like door lock feature although i have 
careful take my keys me because doesnt know you have left your
keys car when passively arms locks doors you 
meticulous about taking your keys you takes care rest
 car ford probe gt used great shape

i looked seriously alpine system too real nice system 
more money has motion sensor standard instead shock sensor 
 shock sensor betterand viper shock sensor better cycle
than optional alpine one imho i think viper gives you lot good
value money isnt absolutely tamperproof system 
except maybe one james bond had his lotus your eyes only 
anyone know where we can get one those installed maybe what 
had van world trade center huh
