 i have pair sport seats from mr sale blueblack

 owner mr having several friends who own them
i am very uncomfortable when i see ad like i have known
several people who have lost seats from mr middle
 night support celica retrofit trade 
insurance companies have been very miserable deal 
 all cases 

when seats seen sale most often stolen
so would nice see statement saying where came from
 would least help soothe reflexive fear someone
 making buck someone elses expense

ill give seller benefit doubt people should 
aware vast majority mr seats marketespecially
those celicasare stolen

i am original owner seats original poster 
i take very serious offence your statement 
i see lot computers advertized net my friend just had been
releived his machine all netcomputer ads stolen computers

seats due my back problem why i had reuse mr brackets
 thats why mr seats i sell attached celica brackets
