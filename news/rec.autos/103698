 so many newsgroups so little time


i bought brand new chevrolet k hd x extended cab last
may has had many many problems see my earler post describes
 situation i went bbb arbitration ruled chevrolet
must buy back from me you do get one stay away from speed
manual deep low first gear have put three them my
truck so far after about miles overdrive either starts
rattling hissing loudly way fix them chevrolet 
says noise characteristic transmission

also you planning use your truck tow 
gear ratios tranny suck steep hill you get up about
 mph second gear rpm yellow line you shift third
 rpm drop only you begin loose speed i should
point out v put hd gvw trucks 
detuned motor compared one put light duty ones 
dropped compression ratio supposedly engine longevity
reasons so light duty may pull better than my truck does
other things have gone wrong include ventilation fan times 
so far paint had specs rust embedded paint from being
shipped rail covering suspension parts link between
stabilizer control arm fell off

any company can make bad individual car chevrolet included what
really bothered me way reacted made attempt
 deal me except tell me take back dealer 
them attempt fix one more time so i bought brand new
ford f hd super cab automatic i never
buy another chevrolet
