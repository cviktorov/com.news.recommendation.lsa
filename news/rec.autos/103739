jeremy g mereness zonkercmuedu says

can anyone offer any opinions ford probe ala how do 
 long run repair records reliability mileage etc

ive found mine probe gt do quite well 

window problem deleted artical has been trimmed

i have had my probe looked twice my local dealer where i purchased
 car first time made problem worse second time
after advising them service bulletin mentioned my fordprobe mailing
list said didnt know bulletin adjusted window 
made much better however now makes scritch scritch noise rough
roads still squeals when i openclose window wet weather anyone
elsess do 

ive had any air leakage problems have been reported 
do get squeal bill describes i live seattle so wet weather
may factor

ford only gives key car cmon ford spend extra few pennies

 i recall correctly i got two keys

horn buttons behind air bag spokes 
center personal preference

youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons 
terrible

 true im wondering may safety concern ie people
pound place where airbag lives

speaking horn i surprised find probe comes one
 those nice merican sounding horns instead japanese sounding kind
 previous probes had japanese horns

 opinion

transmission speed must

i have always been speed guy almost every car ive ever owned has been
 speed because i got good deal car miles i
knowingly overlooked fact has automatic pretty
hightech automatic fully electronicaly controlled speed 

 speed much more fun we opted automatic number 
reasons its still fun some ways more practical

 shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still

ditto

shakes rattles has been my main gripe ive gotten them fix 
worst them i fear rather harsh ride car 
 virtual potpouri rattles when gets older

i too would suspect may true

tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping k 

very very very well sticks road like glue even rough
surface

yes

interior very very nice too very pleasing eye ergonomically
sound

definitely fordmazda did very very nice job one 
car has much more expensive than actually look feel 

ditto

yes cars stiff suspension isnt everyone i personally like 
 you find little harsh otherwise like car id strongly
suggest looking mx

agree check out i dont mind would say much 
stiffer might problem how about r rx suspension 

well i wouldnt encourage passengercarrying probe unless 
person front seat likes sit his knees dash 
mentioned consumer reports writeups consider back seat
 parcel shelf biggie me though had been id 
have bought car its definitely family car

true 

ive heard exhaust system has trouble mine works fine

i havent heard about one i know some very early probes
 maybe had problems prematurely rusting mufflers which

ive had problem read about least i assume one
i had one i read about any case what happened 
weld between muffler pipe feeding ok so im mechanic
broke my case dealer welded ordered replacement parts 
put them when got them i suspect some sort design
flaw production flaw any case i have earlier model would
expect worked out newer ones any case warrantee
repair get keys back

from what ive heard sounds like fordmazda had some qc problems 
 probe probably mx when first went production 
i think problems have mostly been corrected point thats
almost always expected completely new car like though

i have agree seem have some qc problesm i seriously
feel car design sound expect do very well

i second seems some things slipped through 
car seems very sound while perfection what you get awful
lot your money
