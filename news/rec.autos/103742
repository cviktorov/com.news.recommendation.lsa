let me explain why i feel bogey counter feature gimmick
radar waves bounce off objects especially metal how radar
speed measurement works high frequency microwave x band approx 
ghz k approx ghz sent out reflected back 
antenna off automobile other objects object moving
 doppler shift about hz per mph x band occurs measured
 converted miles per hour waves bounce all over 
place can reflect many times go many directions

from what i understand valentine can only tell 
microwaves coming from front rear both only
two antennas coming from both interpreted 
side bogey bogey counts determined sources 
relative strength one another even reflections 
same source

im certainly engineer really have scientific basis
 which make argument dont you answer your own
question reflected signal shifted all from 
act being reflected so wouldnt easy 
 detector discriminate between reflections direct
sources

here problem since microwaves reflect how does unit
tell source reflection take valentine 
drive local grocery store uses xband radar door
opener you can tell small black box above door pointed
down about degree angle your detector going off when 
gets near valentine count bogeys from all
directions front rear sides doesnt say which side 
count changes cars drive reflections change 
 sources store i go i drive around 
standard detector i can only find one source door
opener front door
