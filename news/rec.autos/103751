odometer does work mentioned before
idle bit bouncy going from rpm rpm
wipers slow
thats teh gripes owner says he changed radiator alternator
rotors calipers exhaust
 biggest problem owner shifty sob telling strange
stories i hate i would never buy from persom like except how
often you see descent i amount money he also said 
although i could bring mechanicin he wouldnt let me check car taking

 garage suspicious who knows what milage 
so let me know what check given theres practically rust
i know article i rd few years back anybody remembers
what issue
mikes

dont buy all things you mentioned just give you headaches
later also sounds like car needs lot work you probably
know bmws cheap fix either owner sounds like shady
character just trying take advantage someone sure sounds good
 you should calculate how much repairs sounds like you
would have sink least get everything fixed more
also never trust anyone far mileage concerned who knows how many
miles how driven sure people tell you bmws hold up 
you have consider any car subject wear tear all you know 
could have miles thing you have remember 
isnt last i around either just wait keep shopping around 
 you can probably find one better needs less repair has
legitimate mileage unlike one you considering take from guy who
has been taken couple times good luck
