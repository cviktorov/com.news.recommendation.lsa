 im going argue issue carrying weapons i would ask you 
 you would have thought seriously about shooting kid setting off your
 alarm i can think worse things world glad you got out 
 before did anything give you reason fire your gun
 
i think people have right kill defend property why 
honest do you really care more about scum than about your car

yo watch attributionsi didnt say 

again isnt appropriate forum discussions whether you
should shoot someone property damagevandalismtheft every
responsible gun owner realizes limits punishment
must fit crime i mean think about itis really harmless
prank worth killing over

 i said situation described punks setting off alarms 
taunting people come out could turn very ugly very quickly 
 worth being prepared when your life potentially line
