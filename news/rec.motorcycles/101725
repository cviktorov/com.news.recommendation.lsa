suggest mcquires plastic polish help somewhat nothing 
 remove deep scratches without making worse than already 
mcquires do something fine light stuff

also suggest calling your local plastic shop calif tap plastic 
 chain carries most what needed repair sometimes
replacement plastic bits telephone bay area 
im sure how amenable shipping i have found 
have several excellent products cleaning removing crap from
windscreens face shields also have one called liftit which
works real well removing sticky stuffs adhessives from plastic
wihtout scratching same

luck
