 alan nothing personal i object we all statement
 i many those rides alan describing pushing 
 envelope does necessarily equal taking insane chances

moreover two riders riding together same speed
one might riding well beyond his abilities other
may have safety margin left

oh come phil youre excellent rider you still take plenty 
chances dont tell me its just your skill keeps you from 
getting wacked theres lot luck thrown too youre very
good rider very lucky one too hope your luck holds 

allan i know circumstances several your falls
 ride when you fell while i next behind you
you made error judgement riding too fast when
you knew road damp you reacted badly when
you were surprised oncoming car crash 
due factors were subject your control

i wont deny theres combination luck skill
involved each us seems youre blaming
bad luck more your own pain than warranted
