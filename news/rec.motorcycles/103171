riding work last week via hwy from suisun i i pulled over 
 chp black white gas station jameson canyon road 
officer stated looked like you were going kinda fast coming down
highway you must have been going least i just said okay
 did agree disagree anything he said 

 can you beat ticket personally i think its your duty citizen
 make much trouble possible them so maybe theyll give up
 leave us alone someday soon
 cop certainly within his legal rights nail you guessing
your speed mr brown author fight your ticket mentions 
oakland judge who convicted speeder officers testimony 
 drivers car sounded like being driven excessive speed
 you can pay off state your insurance company you can
take court creative personally ive never won way
 seen anyone win judge always listens politely i havent
seen many attempts
 you could try argument since bikes shorter than 
cars whose speed nice officer accustomed guessing therefore
appear further away so speed appears greater than
 actually i left out step two you get idea you
can make convincing theoretically youre supposed win
 ive never tried proving cop mistaken i did get see
some other poor biker try he mixing up various facts like
 maximum acceleration cop car distance which
 cop had been pacing him end up demonstrating he couldnt
possibly have been going fast cop had suggested hed
brought diagrams calculator he prepared he lost keep
 mind cops do all time word better than yours
maybe though dont guess how fast bikes going all time
besides guy didnt speak english very well ended up absolutely
confounding judge cop everyone else room whod been
recently criminalized some twit gun quota
 ahem ok im better now maybe hed have won had his presentation
been more polished maybe he did get applause
