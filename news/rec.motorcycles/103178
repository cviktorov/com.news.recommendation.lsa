 can you beat ticket personally i think its your duty citizen
 make much trouble possible them so maybe theyll give up
 leave us alone someday soon
 cop certainly within his legal rights nail you guessing
 your speed mr brown author fight your ticket mentions 
 oakland judge who convicted speeder officers testimony 
 drivers car sounded like being driven excessive speed

cough choke what cop gave me ticket sounding like
i speeding id probably show up court without lawyer simply
because sounding like speeding ridiculous i found guilty
id appeal show up lawyer

 cop doesnt do one 

vascar from car plane
radar lidar other electronic speed measuring device
pace me

 im within mph so limit id go court i can accept 
cop seeing me going excessively fast like over limit 
he looked like he going so zone beyond 
reasonable doubt granted i may well lose case measured
 eye take court sure
