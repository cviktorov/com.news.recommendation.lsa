how do helmetless do 

um same way people do 
horseback

 fast would probably enjoy eating bugs anyway

every bit fast dirtbike right terrain we eat
flies thank you

who mentioned dirtbikes were talking highway speeds here you go mph
 your dirtbike feel free contribute

jeeps

youre supposed keep windscreen up

 why does go down

because wouldnt jeep didnt friend mine just bought one
 has more warning stickers than those little wheelers i guess thats
becuase its big wheeler anyway its written about ten places 
 windshield should remain up all times looks like theyve made
 pain put down anyway from what he says fair i do admit
 would similar matter drive windscreenless jeep 
highway bikers may participate discussion theyre
probably few far between so i maintain topic interest
primarily bikers

snow skis

 bugs most poeple who go fast wear goggles

so do most helmetless motorcyclists

notice how ed picked more insignificant lower case part 
two parts statement besides around here quite rare see 
bikers wear goggles street its either full face shield 
open face either nothing aviator sunglasses my experience 
bicycling contact lenses sunglasses says nonwraparound 
sunglasses do almost nothing keep crap out ones eyes

 question still stands how do cruiser riders negligible helmets
stand being highway mph buggy summer evenings

helmetless goggleless

ok ok fine whatever you say lets make some attmept stick 
point ive been out road where i had stop every half hour clean
my shield were so many bugs my jacket would bloodsplattered
mess id see guys shorty helmets goggles long beards tight
tshirts merrily cruising along bikes windscreens lets really
specific time so even ed understands does anbody think 
splattering bugs ones face fun other reasons do 
image laziness make point about freedom bug splattering
