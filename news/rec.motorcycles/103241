id like thank everyone who took time respond my post about 
fighting my ticket

many you wrote say you have successfully fought won your 
case court others lost due cop outright lying judge 
about circumstances surrounding your ticket while one fellow lost
because judge just didnt appear mood foolishness

several you suggested i obtain book called fight your ticket

 general theme from those who said go prepared 
i should do much research possible go back review scene 
transcribe what happened tape paper use any witnesses may 
have been around have list questions ask cop andor judge
 positive assertive i am innocent until proven guilty gulp

 few people suggested trying get my court date changed might 
trip up arresting officer he may show up date his day
off he feelsknows he doesnt have chance win against you

one individual stated officer could expert witness he
says i speeding damn i speeding

another says i must have been paced clocked radar gun

lots good suggestions ideas from you all ill let you know what
happens after big day
