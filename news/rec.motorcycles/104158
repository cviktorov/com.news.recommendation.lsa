my solution never ride next car

 only thing between you them space
keep much possible

take one step further 

never dillydally rear either side cage when you pass
make positive possible you cant pass fully least make
sure you attempt you can make driver aware you least
getting his area vision

 also applies merging another lane after making pass do 
 positively possible what i try do look rear view
 over my shoulder after ive done accelerate 
lane so you have speed cushion should you have missed seeing 
potential bdi thats trying do same thing you worse ie
he may have been behind you saw you made pass successfully you arent
going fast enough suite him so he tries go around you right

ride four eyes
