 last year i believe jeff deeney posted what ive since come 
 recognize ultimate april fools posting ever wasnt particularly
 nice him several people were quite fooled very worried about
 him i cant fault effectiveness

based numerous inputs most them unprintable i deemed time 
kinder gentler april i didnt have something really sick 
twisted ready post perhaps next year 

personally i think jeffypoo still smarting more from third degree
burns he suffered after april st last year rather than supposed burns
 he suffered joke granted i one those people were
taken i certainly concernedand pissed him 
pulling thing which i made known him

 again april fool joke i would also go record saying
 best orchestrated one ive ever seen certainly sucked
 lot people believing 

sick twisted who group could ever accused thing

i tip my twisted lid thee jeffy
