i cant think another subject generates much contradictory
advice traffic laws enforcement everybodys got 
opinion dead certain right yet acurate information 
extremely difficult come dmv doesnt know cops dont
know your traffic school instructor doesnt know vehicle code
only tells part story judges choose interpret laws 
wide variety ways public large i seldom hear any
advice doesnt disagree something ive experienced

 you dont believe me i suggest you get copy vehicle code
study sit day two court see what really
happens read fight your ticket too dont miss little
section end where says your chances lousy youre
basically screwed

 you may have guessed im pretty down system here 
california ive carefully prepared court bringing witnesses 
revealing serious holes officers story only slapped 
 maximum allowable fine plus assessments over 
message clear judge does appreciate john q public trying
his own cases

so heres my advice when you find yourself ticket take traffic
school you can its serious matter get lawyer lawyer
can present exact same case you difference 
sentence
