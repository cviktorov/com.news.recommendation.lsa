 we only talking about stroke i think i can understand exhaust
pulse affect stroke intake valve closed 
exhaust stroke gas pushed out cyclinder i guess
 some gas compression may affect amount pushed out
 limiting factor seems header pipe 
canister meaning would gases so far down line canister
really have effect exhaust stroke do gases really 
compress much

 discussion purposes i ignore dynamic effects like pulses
 exhaust pipe try paint useful mental picture

 unless engine supercharged pressure available force
air intake tract atmospheric time intake
valve opened pressure differential available move air only
 difference between combustion chamber pressure left over after
 exhaust stroke atmospheric piston decends 
intake stroke combustion chamber pressure decreased allowing
atmospheric pressure move more air intake tract time
does pressure ever become negative even approach good
vacuum

 time exhaust valve closing pressure 
combustion chamber essentially pressure exhaust system up
 first major flow restriction muffler note volume
 gas must flow through exhaust much larger than volume
 must flow through intake because temperature
difference products combustion

 last years japanese manufacturers have started
paying attention exhaust intake tuning pursuit almighty
horsepower point time highperformance bikes
substitution aftermarket freeflow air filter have almost
zero affect performance because stock intake system flows very
well anyway substitution aftermarket exhaust system make
very little difference unless general new exhaust system 
much louder than stocker

 older bikes exhaust backpressure dominating factor
 freeflowing air filters were substituted very little difference
 noted unless freeflowing exhaust system installed well

 general engine can visualized air pump any
given rpm anything cause engine pump more air 
 intake exhaust side cause produce more horsepower
pumping more air require recalibration rejetting carburetor
