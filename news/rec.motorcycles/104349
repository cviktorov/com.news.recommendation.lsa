those you who thinking about fiamms you might also want think
about airhorns i just installed set bosch air horns ordered from 
dennis kirk pg latest catalog my fj rated
 db meters i installed them using gage wire from battery 
 relay compressor ground my stock horn connectors fit relay
pins just fine i soldered connections relay compressor used
 crimp type battery connector inline amp fuseconnector from napa
i installed compressor just forward fuse box front
fairing tie wrapping between steering head frame black steel tube
frame used support front fairing you have remove front fairing 
do fits outside frame inside fairing two
vertical supports just front fuses depending how tight your fairing
follows frame you should able fit somewhere fairing
 compressor about diameter about long
 relay mounted front steering head frame small
so should plenty good places 
i found perfect place horns required only tie wraps 
mount horns fit inside front fairingframe stick out either side
just front air scoops behind turn signals back 
horns point back towards center bike come real close where
 gas tank connects front part frame just enough
room outside allow full lock lock clearance nice
cut outs frame back horn go 
 short horn even fairing long one sticks out
about inch so really noticable unless you look
closely end up pointing down slightly maybe degrees from straight
ahead perfect those cagers trying change lanes you
 you have any other questions about mounting email i can try
 explain better your bike red you may want paint them
first
how do work you ask very very very loud sound
more like european sports car than truck vast improvement over stock
i have used them least daily since installing them amp fuse has
 blown yet although duration horn blasts have been short
ive repeatedly scared shit out my friends them even though
 know i have horns still jump perfect keeping
 pedestrians sidewalk
 bottom line work loud enough cause pain suffering 
those stupid lane changing cages well take few years off lives
 relatively easy install fj ymmv
