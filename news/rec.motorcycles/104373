hey ed you didnt give me chance sheesh

 answer absolutely ed so eloquently describes

edput two riders identical machines its 
edone who knows what hes doing why faster may
edbe possible improve your technique you have idea what 
edthrough trial error very effective methodology
edonly understanding technique steering motorcycle can one
 
edimprove technique i hold applies any human
edendeavor

herein lies key thread

kindly note difference responses ed i talking
about knowing riding technique while mike arguing knowing physics
behind possible taught technique countersteering
ie push bar inside turn go way without
having learn all fizziks about gyroscopes ice cream cones
 seen parallel thread stuff mainly interest
 technomotorcycle geeks like readers recmotorcycles 
 doesnt need taught average student learning csteering
mike doesnt seem able make distinction i know people
who can carve circles around me who couldnt tell you who newton 
 other hand i know very intelligent welleducated people who
think you steer motorcycle either leaning steering
 la bicycles combination knowledge physics
doesnt get you squat knowledge technique does
