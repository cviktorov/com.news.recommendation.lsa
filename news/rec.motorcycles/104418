 ultra sticky labels printed your
 favourite curse good even our local hospitals use them instead 
 wheel clamps putting one about size each window cage
 
 apartment complex where i used live tried only put 
 thing over drivers window so couldnt miss friend
 damned near wrecked way home one night her vision blocked 
 sticker i suggested manager enormous liability 
 were assuming pulling stunt

 logic has anything do 
i can see liability putting stickers car while moving
 something its bdi chooses start drive car
 known unsafe condition would seem liable furthermore 
would have had last chance avoid unsafe situation which 
additional factor attributing blame

anyway stickers window less effective one has any problem
taking blade window remove stubborn sticker its different
story nice paint job door
