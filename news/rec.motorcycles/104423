hg makes vpilot jackets mine very similar style made
 just leather san jose i bought one last two 
ever made

finding decent womens motorcycling gear easy lot
 stuff out thats fringed everywhere made fashion leather
made fit men etc i dont know shop your area 
 some women rider friendly places san franciscosan jose
