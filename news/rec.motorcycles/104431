 especially frustrating
 highway bike likes cruise about mph which happens

 from gpz does anyone have any suggestions fix besides
 restoring stock
 

new carbs why would fix you still have get 
jetting right match what seems extremely overly lean condition
you added more free flowing exhaust higher flowing filters 
chances its lean may bethats big fun 
carb tuning its very tricky

 guessing game long time
