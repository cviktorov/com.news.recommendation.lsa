mjsalso imho telling newbies about countersteering er counterproductive
mjscos just confuses them i rode around quite happily years 
mjsknowing nothing about countersteering i cannot say i ride any differently
mjsnow i know about 

i interpret mean youre representative every other
motorcyclist world eh mike rather presumptive you

imho my humble opinion

leavittthe time learn countersteering techniques when you first
leavittstarting learn before you develop any bad habits i rode 
leavittfive years before taking my first course msf erc learning
leavittabout how countersteer its now eight years later i still
leavitthave consciously tell myself dont steer countersteer old
leavitthabits die hard bad habits even harder

mjssorry bill complete bollocks you learned how countersteer 
mjsthe first time you rode bike its natural intuitive 

sorry mike im going kick over can you countersteer
over mph stone ones been kicked around enough sake 
argument ill concede its countersteering sake argument only

mjsmsf did teach you how countersteer only told you what
mjsyou were already doing

 theres value 


i didnt say value all i said very confusing
 newbies 

 theres big difference knowing
whats happening how make do especially extreme
case emergency swerve just letting bike do whatever
 does make itself turn once i knew precisely what happening
 how make do abruptly command my emergency avoidance
abilities improved tenfold mention big improvement my normal
cornering ability i am much more proficient knowing how countersteer
 motorcycle rather than letting motorcycle steer itself 
when i remember take cognitive command bike rather than letting
 run itself through corners whereupon i return my original
comment better learn whats happening right from start how
 take charge rather than developing bad habit merely going
along ride

bill you kidding yourself here firstly motorcycles do steer
themselves only rider can do secondly adhesion 
tyre road suspension geometry ground clearance 
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve avoid obstacles 
 knowledge physics between riders ears you seriously
suggesting countersteering knowledge enables you corner faster
 more competently than you could manage otherwise


mike im extremely gratified you you have natural
affinity prowess motorcycling formal training total
waste time you assuming your total training hasnt come from
simply from reading recmotorcycles however motorcyclists
ive discussed formal rider education have regarded experience
 overwhelmingly positive regardless amount experience
 brought course ranging from minutes years

formal training country far i am aware does include
countersteering theory i found out about countersteering about six years ago
from physics lecturer who also motorcyclist i didnt believe him
 first when he said i steered my bike right make turn left
 i went out analysed closely what i doing realized he 
right its interesting bit knowledge ive had lot fun since
 telling others about who were first sceptical i 
thats all interesting bit knowledge claim 
 essential all bikers know you can corner faster
 better result absurd

formal training my view absolutely essential youre going 
 able ride bike properly safely including countersteering
theory newbie courses we confusing people unnecessarily right 
 time when far more important matters them learn
 my original point
