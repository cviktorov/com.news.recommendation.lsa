 after both oil changes oil level top mark 
window lower right side motor ive been noticing
 oil level seen window gradually decreases over 
miles im always checking window bike level ground
 after has sat idle awhile so oil has chance drain
back pan bike isnt leaking oil any place i dont
see any smoke coming out exhaust

 my owners manual says amount oil corresponding 
high low marks oil level window approx quart 
looks like my bike has been using about quarts miles 
owners manual also gives figure max oil consumption about
ozmile lkm

 my question whether degree oil consumption im seeing 
my bike normal have any other k owners seen oil level
gradually consistently go down should i take bike 
work im asking local guys also get many data points i
can 


its normal bmw k bikes use little oil first few thousand 
miles i dont know why ive had three new k bikes all three used 
bit oil when new max maybe quart first miles soon quits
 time i had miles them oil consumption about zero
ive been told harder you run bike within reason sooner
 stops using any oil
