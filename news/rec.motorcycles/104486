 all us argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand
 technique countersteering

including all ones who think countersteer all way
through corner

 underlying physics 
different matter need taught beginners 

agreed

countersteering
 technique should taught only understanding 
technique can one develop maximally effective emergency avoidance
manuvers

 really only thing we disagree maybe we should agree 
disagree i still think telling newbies steer left turn
 right unnecessarily confusing when theyll do anyway 
just get bike ride damn thing


 i know exactly whats happening its those other gits 
havent clue 


me too




understanding physics traction fine i cannot see how
detailed theory like has any place motorcyle training course
all you need know maximum traction obtained tyre
just beginning slide against road

 we violent disagreement while what you state true 
 insufficient form traction management policy available
traction increases applied normal force ie traction available 
 front wheel increases weight shifts under braking forces 
correspondingly decreases rear thus technique applying
both brakes easing off rear increasing pressure 
front can best learned understanding weight shift 
available traction

jeez ed when you started talking about traction management policies i
thought you were making some weird reference looking after railway
locomotives

 official line here though i do have my doubts about 
front brake applied first followed rear brake idea being
 you avoid locking up rear after weight transfer takes place 
practice i suspect most people do what you describe

saying brake until tire just begins slide next useless
advice newbie he has go out slide tire find out
where also gives him zero information from which 
develop braking technique changes braking 
corresponding weight shift develop

 you dont slide tyre you have way knowing whether youve
achieved maximum braking im suggesting you should always
aim brake hard you possibly can you want find 
limits machine you have go beyond them 

 any case maximum braking i suggested you aim keep
both wheels just point sliding youll doing
exactly you suggest
