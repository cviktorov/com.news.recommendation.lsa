 i dont end up replacing real near future would i do better 
 wear my totally nondamaged face dotrated cheapie which doesnt fit 
 well keep out wind well wearing shoei rf which 
 lot more comfortable keeps wind out better quieter might 
 have some minor damage
 
 wear rf even after few drops paint chips far better
 than helmet poorly fitting one ive had many scratches bangs
 which have been repaired plus im still confident protection 
 helmet continue give me only when you actually see depressions
 
 actual cracks using magnifying glass should you consider replacement

 

 good advice couple years i involved lowspeed
getoff which i landed my back pavement my head helmeted
hit pavement clunk leaving couple dings chips 
paint point impact other visible damage i called 
helmet manufacturer inquired about damage said way 
fiberglass shell works first give delaminate crack
 way fiberglass serves spread force impact over 
wider area after fiberglass has done its thing crushable foam
liner takes care absorbing hopefully remaining impact force
 told me second stage fiberglass functionality delamination
 glassresin layers can occur visible signs either inside 
outside helmet suggested i send them helmet 
would inspect including xraying i did so sent back helmet
 letter stating could find damage would
compromise ability helmet provide maximum protection
i suspect letter would eliminate being able claim
prior damage helmet event i were sue them

 bottom line though appears helmets integrity
can compromised visible signs only way know sure
 send back have inspected note some helmet
manufacturers provide inspections services some do another point
 consider when purchasing lid
