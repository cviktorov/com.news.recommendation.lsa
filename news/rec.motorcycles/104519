several years ago while driving cage dog darted out quiet
intersection right front me enough distance
between us so i didnt have slow down however nd dog
suddenly appeared collided my right front bumper 
 force impact enough kill scottish terrier

apparently following st dog henceforth dog
decides cross street keep eye out nd dog 
many dogs like travel pairs packs 

ive yet experience dog chasing me my black gli which
has pretty loud oem horn good fiamms good enuff
 bike large heavy enough run right over one 
 smaller nippers while larger ones would have trouble
getting my leg between saddlebags engine guards id
def feel more vulnerable my trump thatd easier
leg chewing target those mongrels

 theres persistent dog running after bikers despite
complaints owner i wouldnt adverse running
over my truck dogs life isnt worth much imho
compared child riding bike who gets knocked 
ground said dog dies from head injury 

any dog neighborhood thats vicious public menace
running about unleashed fair game road kill candidate
