well sounds great me when i have real bdi cager tailgating me
ive found effective strategy flash my brake light 
pumping pedal you obviously need bit free play your
brake pedal do seems even most brain dead idiot can
usually discern flashing red light directly front 
himherit may mean something wrong

 two problems id see your strategy red light may
change before you can get anything meaningful out your mouth 
occupants may take exception your opinions demonstrate 
physically you your nowparked bike admittedly latter 
slim chance would enough give me pause


 slmr sometimes you get windshield sometimes bug
