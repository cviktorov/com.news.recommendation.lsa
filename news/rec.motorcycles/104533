 formal training my view absolutely essential youre going 
 able ride bike properly safely including countersteering
 theory newbie courses we confusing people unnecessarily right 
 time when far more important matters them learn
 my original point
 
 mike

while i agree you formal training essential safe riding
i disagree strongly your original point point formal training 
must prepare riders road preparedness my opinion
 know much possible so exclude some aspects riding bike 
 course wrong imho now countersteering particular
countersteering something must trained common reaction among 
new bikers bicycle riders emergency situation steer 
motorcycle like bicycle we know makes motorcycle go 
direction opposite what intended needless say dangerous
i have specific example rider left turn rider thinks heshe
 close right shoulder road tries steer 
motorcycle left pulling left handle pushing right 
handle motorcycle straightens up goes off road 
 worse scenario same rider same turn middle turn
 rider sees truck coming towards himher panicking rider tries
 steer motorcycle away from truck crashes right 

 main function riding course teach how avoid emergency 
situations what do one thus knowledge training 
countersteering imho must any riding course
