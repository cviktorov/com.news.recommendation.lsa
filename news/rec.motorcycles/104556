 incidentally best lock ive found bikes cobra lock
 its cable which shrouded articulated hardened steel sleeve
 lock itself cylindrical locking pawl engages joints
 articulation points so chain can adjusted like handcuffs
 you cant get any leverage lock break open cylinder
 wellprotected i wouldnt want cut one without torch
 andor vice heavy duty cutting wheel

i have long cobralinks lock i used use my harley she
doesnt get out much anymore so i dont use lock often anymore 
 made articulated steel shells covering seven strands steel cable
 probably enough stop all joyriders unfortunately
professionals can open rather easily

 freeze link

 break frozen link your favorite method hammers work well

 snip through steel cables which i have authority 
frightfully thin set boltcutters

 same money you can get kryptonite cable lock which 
anywhere from thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded
 flexible covering protect your bikes finish has barreltype
locking mechanism i dont know its adjustable my source says its
more difficult pick than most locks cable tends squish flat
 boltcutter jaws rather than shear model

all bets off thief has die grinder cutoff wheel
even most durable locks tested yield tool less than one minute

fyi ill getting krypto cable next paycheck

later
