dsthe spagthorpe viking

ds i must have missed article spagthorpe viking 
dsthat one little illuminated dragons head front
dsfender style later copied indian round side covers

 all viking trick little unit made way back when
forties fifties when spag trying make go racing
 first iteration springer boxer twin very similar max
frizs famous design overhead point cam see below 
more valvetrain problem thing had ground
clearance whatsoever solution curve cylinder bores so
 ground clearance substantially increased


 springer motor front
 viking motor front 

 roughly idea except bores were gradually curved
around radius pistons were loath make sharpangled turn
 middle stroke engine also had curved connecting
rods accomodate stroke

 engine stuck out so far because its revolutionary still
unique overhead cam system through use clever valve timing 
 extrordinarily trick valve linkage only single cam lobe 
required drive both overhead valves

just revolutionary hydraulic valve actuation which used 
pressurized stream oil power waterwheel which kept lobe
spinning over one side effect required some rather brutal
engineering fixes until engines oil pressure came up 
normal engines valve timing would more less random
resulting some impressive startup valve damage solution 
little hand crank pressurized cases before you started 
beast remarkably similar system used new porsches 
pressurize oil system before car started cage however
uses electric oil pump wimps

despite fix engine had nasty propensity explosively
firing its valves pistons when cylinder would temporarily
lose bit oil pressure corner solution run even
higher oil pressures change gaskets seals regularly 
 feasible because racing engine

 just single overhead lobe pushrodshaftchain towers
because hydraulic system head engine came 
almost perfect point

 
 lobe
 xx complex linkage shown due 
 valvestems complexity
 
 
 piston
 
 note tip truly vertical
 about degree angle 
 ground drawing doesnt show 
 curvature because none 
 head itself bore curve would start
 about where cylinder bore disappears 
 diagram


 effect pointy heads top pair gently pundits 
 day even said sensuously curved cylinders much like pair 
finned viking horns poking out from beneath gas tank thus 
name

 vik moderately successful racer lightning fast when 
worked plagued problems relating its revolutionary
technology eventually dumped when spag finally realized 
racing where spagthorpe name would made machines
were raced another year two privateers fate
approximately six vikings were made plus one possibly two
springers confusing issue one old spag staffer who swears up 
down machine tooled production many 
twenty thirty machines may have come off line however modern
record production viking has survived most motorcycle
historians discount story
