 same money you can get kryptonite cable lock which 
anywhere from thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded
 flexible covering protect your bikes finish has barreltype
locking mechanism i dont know its adjustable my source says its
more difficult pick than most locks cable tends squish flat
 boltcutter jaws rather than shear model

fyi ill getting krypto cable next paycheck

 word warning though kryptonite also sells almost useless cable
locks under kryptonite name

when i obtained my second motorcycle i migrated one my kryptonite 
ulocks from my bicycle new bike i went out shopping 
 new lock bicycle

 about same money i had choice kryptonite cable lock
advantages lock front back wheels bicycle keep them both
kryptonite name cheesy noname ulock advantages real steel
i chose kryptonite cable after less than week i took back 
disgust exchanged cheesy noname ulock

first krypto cable i bought made kryptonite covered 
 kryptonite guarantee doesnt even approach kryptonite standards 
quality quality assurance just some generic madeintaiwan cable
lock kryptonite name 

secondly latch engagement mechanism something joke i
dont know mine particularly poor example often
quite frustrating get latch positively engage sometimes
 would seem engage only fall open when i went unlock 

thirdly lock has little plastic door keyway which serves
 sole purpose frustrating any attempt insert key 
dark i didnt try obviously i have my doubts 
lock mechanism would stand up insert screwdriver torque
attack

fourthly cable my opinion sufficient thickness 
deter theft my piece crap bicycle all cables suffer 
weakness can cut few strands time you patient
you can cut cables fingernail clippers aviation snips would go 
through cable well under minute
