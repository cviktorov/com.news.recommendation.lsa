been involved drunkrelated accidents them were hit
 my cousin still recovering

 i cant take back what happened

yes stupid

 reminding me about all time youre
neither helping me yourself so stuff your opinion

hey man you brought up i agree completely driving drunk really
stupid i understand appreciate you feel bad about 
dwi endemic our society real problem we 
motorcyclists can worst vulnerable positions around drunk
driver alert readers might remember last year i witnessed dwi
accident right bloody front me unable save life 
 one participants i reported here also drunk driving 
motorcyclists prime cause injury death which raises 
insurance rates forces stupidly restrictive laws turns public
against those us who ride responsibly

 my view drunk driving should carry mandatory prison sentence
 one traffic offenses which public funds issue
 genuine safety issue so you bring up subject recmoto
admitting having been caught dwi looking sympathy over 
consequences dont expect people respond warm wishes
