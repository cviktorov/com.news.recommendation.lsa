what best books have been written regard 
aerostich really depends your particular size shape needs
 you upper lower body proportional according aero
dimensions probably going better mixing matching
 piece suit i have piece suit i am very happy 
having my life quota scars from crashing off road i am very
concerned good protection i believe difference 
protection between piece suits almost negligible i
think optional hip pads back protector make much more 
difference one thing nice about piece you go
somewhere want walk around while still jacket
you can just detach stow pants 

one thing note goldfine has problems getting good fit 
many women standard suits supposedly smaller women 
petite men matter piece fit better 

another recommendation pay mods you need them i wish i
got inches added my pant legs i find long suits 
really long i cant imagine how short standard suits must
