stock harley pipes make enough noise draw someones attention

get how many feet bike going mph goes seconds 
how long would take me push my horn button

 we do i think youd loose sure youre hands already 
throttle your thumb already near horn button pushing 
horn button one simple move revving throttle requires either
engaging clutch accelerating first more complex
manuver than simple horn button push second aint too bright
when potential hazard ahead besides unique sound 
horn more effective attracting attention bdi cagers than
 sound engine which what expect hear you 
 road

 usually case single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
safety procedure

 answer feet
