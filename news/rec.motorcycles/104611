secondly adhesion 
tyre road suspension geometry ground clearance 
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve avoid obstacles 
 knowledge physics between riders ears you seriously
suggesting countersteering knowledge enables you corner faster
 more competently than you could manage otherwise

 hes i put two riders identical machines its 
one who knows what hes doing why faster may
 possible improve your technique you have idea what 
through trial error very effective methodology
only understanding technique steering motorcycle can one
improve technique i hold applies any human
endeavor

thats all interesting bit knowledge claim 
 essential all bikers know you can corner faster
 better result absurd

do you consider understanding physics traction absurd
 you seriously suggesting one can form traction management
policy without understanding what what factors increase 
decrease available traction braking

 highly unlikely any biker going develop his maximum
swerving ability without any knowledge turning techniques most
 his riding life may problem emergency
situation very definately placing him disadvantage

 including countersteering
theory newbie courses we confusing people unnecessarily right 
 time when far more important matters them learn

i disagree existance immense success riding courses which
teach technique indicate concept can taught manner
 neither confusing nor detracts from any other aspects 
course

 my original point

perhaps ensuing discussion you strayed far from 
point claim knowledge steering technique irrelevant 
riders ability i find assertion ludicrous


ed green former ninjaite i drinking last night biker

dod go get know her youll like her
 grateful dead seemed like least i could do
