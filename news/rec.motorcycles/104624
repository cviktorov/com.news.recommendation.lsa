cb dont so stupid leave your helmet seat where can

ryan another good place your helmet your mirror i kid you 

 very bad advice helmets have two major impact absorbing
layers hard outer shell closedcell foam impact layer
most helmets lose protective properties because inner liner
compacts over time long before outer shell damaged 
delaminates from age dr hurt tested helmets many years
following his landmark study has estimated helmet can lose
up its effectiveness from inner liner compression i have
 video he produced discusses phenomenon detail

puncture compression type caused mirrors sissy bars 
other relatively sharp objects worst offender even when 
comfort liner unaffected dents holes foam can seriously
degrade effectiveness helmet you habit 
parking your lid mirrors i suggest you look under 
comfort liner condition foam significantly
damaged missing replace helmet
