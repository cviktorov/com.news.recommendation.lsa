so question i have how dangerous riding 

tough question more dangerous than driving car far more
dangerous you dont apply modicum intelligence 
activity basically stupidity get you hurtkilled lot
faster motorcycle than car care 
 unreasonably dangerous also buying good protective
clothing helpful way something does go wrong
you likely less severely injured

first thing possible take msf driver training course
 get you started right foot teach
control vehicle safe riding practices

second buy protective gear minimum good helmet
 pair leather gloves must good sturdy 
piece footgear also very helpful though leather hiking
boots pair old army boots something similar works fine
 purpose long you make sure laces stay 
tied after those leather jacket leather pants chaps
 nice well also expensive items 
pants many people consider good pair jeans reasonable
preferably recent fairly heavy weight similarly 
 jacket good jean jacket reasonable compromise though
more people tend have leather jackets around than pants another
thing do drop garage sales looking secondhand
leather jacket look fairly thick leather items

third dont do anything stupid dont ride after 
drinking even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement
 balance dont ride snow when conditions
 black ice likely very careful riding
 rain slow way down take corners gingerly 
brake early gently try ride you sick
tired taking any medication drowsiness warnings 
otherwise average shape

 care you should ok

 next question i have what bike would you recommend 
 first time rider i dont want race nor do i want 
ride cross country nor do i want ride dirt trails ill
probably drive back roads occasional rides city
streets freeways maximum i can spend about so
ill looking used bike

i would suggest mid late s japanese midsized standard
something cc range would probably reasonable 
you shorterlighter than average you might want go 
low cc bike

possible models 
 suzuki gs series eg gs gs etc generally
inline bikes generally dependable except tendency 
weakness charging system stator andor regulatorrectifier 
problems my first bike about gs server me well

 honda nighthawk series may also known cb series
i think eg honda cb cb etc another series 
standard motorcycles also fairly dependable

kawasaki yamaha probably have similar bikes i dont know
them well

 mid late s models above you should able 
buy bike under leaving you money protective 
clothing insurance licensing costs

hope helps
