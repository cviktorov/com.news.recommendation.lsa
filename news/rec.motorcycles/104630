sixteen days i had put off test driving honda st finally
 th saturday without much rain fact cleared up 
became warm sunny wind died about three weeks ago i
took long cool ride hawk down cycles test ride
 had sold delivered demo st about fifteen hours
before i arrived demo vfr bikelocked showroom 
surrounded other bikes likely move soon

today different were even more bikes used dirt bikes
 used street bikes cars big tent full outlandishly fat
touring bikes trailers were all squeezed parking lot
some sort fat bike convention shelly dave were running one
msf course each same time one classroom one 
 back lot plus usuall free cookout food 
cycles gives away every weekend summer hmmm seemed like
 big moto party

after about ten minutes looking rob c cheif sales slime
 another minutes reading signing long disclosurelibility
praytogod form i helped jt push st out mess 
parking lot we went over controls i put tank bag from 
 hawk right saddlebag my wife put everything else
 left saddlebag thats nice having helped push 
st out lot i thought best have jt move edge 
 road away from bikes people he rode like 
bicycle cant heavy i thought

well i wrong i sat st both feet down all i could 
think big i put one foot up heavy came mind very
quickly cindy back she back hard 
tell seat three times large hawk seat bike seemed
nearly out control just idling side road

 rpm second gear all weight seemed dissappear even
 bike miles odometer slippery new tires pads 
did yet bite disks things seems smooth sure cycles 
 section few folks ever ride about miles north
 computer concentration about five miles north where i
splits away lighly travelled two lane limited access
highway goes through heavily forested sections hamilton 
manchesterbythesea newbury its way gloucester
 its way meets road winds from sea about
 miles inland andover its way goes through many
thoroughly new england spots perfect slow sport touring sections

cindy has difficulty speed rd gear th gear purring along
 top gear thing has less low rpm grunt my hawk lane 
changes were new experience big heft required move 
thing responds well though wallowing complaint behind 
fairing fairly quiet helmet buffeting 
nontrivial top gear car passing mph nearly effortless
smooth smooth smooth sure what v sound reminds me 
 pleasant only bars were transmitting endless
buzz

 jump caused me less than impressed 
brakes its down hill reversing camber twicereversing radius
decreasing radius turn real squeeze needed front binder 
 section we were tight too urban st works ok
 section shows its weight we went clam shack
oft featured spencer hire place where you could really 
find spencer his house about miles down after putting
through traffic while we turned went back 

about half way through onramp i yanked cindys wrist our singal
 hold tight head check left time find redline second
gear gives good shove third too fourth sees dod speed 
short shift top way we saw cops very light
traffic did cross dod zone because bike too new
well now had miles so ok tried some high effort
lane changes some wide sweeping turns time wick up i went 
until buffeting threating pull us off seat stayed
 when i comfortable wind steering 
i looked down find indicated mph bad up touring

beverly comes fast more than twice posted limit get
off mile sign i rolled off throttle coasted i wanted
 readjust coming slowness good idea were
several manholesized patches sand exit ramp back 
slow heavy behavior cycles about mile from i could 
see even more cars stacked up outside right when i got off i managed
 thread st through cars edge concrete pad
out front heavy took way too much effort cindy i put
 thing center stand i am sure i used side
stand st would have been its side within minute


my demo opinion heavy put diet smooth comfortable
hardly notices dod speed id buy about less than 
list just like too much bike
