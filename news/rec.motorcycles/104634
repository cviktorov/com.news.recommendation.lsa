i need some advice having someone ride pillion me my ninja
 first time ive taken anyone extended ride
read farther than around block well riding some twisty 
fairly bumpy roads mines roadmthamilton loop you sf bay areans

you sonuvabitch rub why dont you we have great weather
 great roads here unlike rest you putzes us nyah nyah
nyah

 severely humorimpaired

 person lbs fairly small so i dont see weight too much
 problem what sort advice should i give her before we go
i want her hold onto me rather than grab rail out back 
ive heard she should look over my shoulder direction were
turning so she leans me what else traditional
signals slow down go faster i hafta go pee etc

youll likely notice her weight too much piece advice
 you dont abrupt throttle wheelies accelerate 
wee bit more slowly than usual consciously worry about spitting her off
 back its much your job keep her pillion hers
 i guarantee shell put off bike ripping out from under her
when you whack open keep lean angles pretty tame first time
out too you her need learn each others body english she needs
 learn what your idea about how take turn you need 
learn her idea shit dont crash now so you dont work cross
purposes while leaned over you can work up more aggressive riding over
time

 very important thing tell her put her hand against tank
when you brakethis could save you some severely crushed cookies

have fun
