 person lbs fairly small so i dont see weight too much
 problem what sort advice should i give her before we go
i want her hold onto me rather than grab rail out back 
ive heard she should look over my shoulder direction were
turning so she leans me what else traditional
signals slow down go faster i hafta go pee etc

ive never liked my passengers try shift weight 
turns all i find weight shift can very sudden 
unnerving its one thing theyre just getting comfortable 
decide look over your other shoulder i dont recommend having
himher shift her weight each turn too violent

also i think someone already said make sure your passenger
wears good gear i sometimes choose ride without helmet 
lacking other safety gear depends how squidly i feel i
wont let passengers do what i do myself i can handle 
i wouldnt want hurt anyone else so i dont let them without
gloves jacket least jeans heavy boots helmet fits

i really want positive experience us both mainly so 
shell want go me again so any help appreciated

go real easy its amazing how solid grip you have 
handle bars your passenger does dont make her feel like
shes going slide off back snappy turns you 
sickening lurches her general feels much less controlled
 smooth passenger i cant stand being back my
brothers bike i ride aggressively when i ride i know hes
 good pilot still everything feels very unsteady when youre
 passenger 


thanks
