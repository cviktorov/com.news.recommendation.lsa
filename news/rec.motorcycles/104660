since least one other person interested 

my fzrs black exhaust pipes rusty i researched getting them repaired
yesterday i bought can vht degree black header paint spent 
hour sanding two header pipes hand sprayed paint thought
about how clean i able get metal sanding determined 
i wouldnt all suprised paint worechipped off month

soooo call couple places up minneapolis discover powder
coating while extremely durable handle over degree
temperatures place i talked said were experimenting 
some new powder supposed handle degrees wouldnt
 available months least directed me another shop 
specializes header coating

 other shop said have coatings available one aluminized 
can do degrees comparable powder coating durability
 other silicon i think based can do degrees 
thinner durable both coatings have textured finish 
super smooth should cleaned hot water brush

price foot header pipes foot collector im
planning take parts up friday get them back ups next week maybe
wednesday

sounds me like kind coating stuff should way better than paint
considering how much abuse pipes get from road craprocks
