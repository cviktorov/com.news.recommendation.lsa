karrdirection i admit ive never actually seen 

ive experienced back when i younger more foolish

my first bike used track extremely true going down highway
i would set throttle tension screw up enough hold gas
steady slide back seat lean against backrest riding
without any hands i needed turn id shift my weight 
turn lo behold bike would turn sans touching bars
granted wouldnt turn very fast proves you can turn
 bike without countersteering least terms input
 bar normally associated countersteering

 ive said i know many people who think all you do lean any
input theyre giving bar totally unconscious whereas 
may sufficient get you down road under normal circumstances
possibly years stretch i cant think anybody whod argue
 preferable properly knowing how manipulate bar
 turn regardless what you want call 

except maybe mr sixsmith
