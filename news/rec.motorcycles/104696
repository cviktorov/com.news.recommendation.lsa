i agree after all when you grab under his chin 
 careful keep your hands away from his twisting head what 
he going do tailwag you death i even had one occasion where
i unexpectedly jumped lb german shepherd grabbed
his upper jaw one hand his lower jaw other now im
holding his mouth open way he strong enough clamp down
 he can do nothing

however all macho shit aside fact when you 
riding bike dog arrowing intercept may unwise
 you stop try deal dog simple fact
 might through your leathers working your jeans
before you can dismount deal properly

 all means you do kick dog otherwise get its attention
stop stay you kick dog ride away 
victory dog drove you out its territory 
even qualified victory victory you kick stop
 sit dogs say oh shit guys serious
 back off now you have established your dominance over dog
 probably bother you again
