singletrack snow vehicles front skis snow skis attached 
skiers legs deform surface snow creating own bank
ice skates alter phase ice also carve out own
tracks
so what 

so have bugger all do motorcycles hence any apparent
similarity handling characteristics may may analagous
 its underlying physics behind motorcycle handling
characteristics

ok one last attempt ill take different tack

we all seem agreement two explanations why
one can use handlebars lean moving motorcycle question 
 one effect dominant which one idea would 
design experiment which would seaprate two characteristics 
see which effect produces similar result one which those 
us who have bikes familiar

lets look one so far has sparked controversy its
own gyroscopic precession examine alone we would have 
get rid contact patch effect allowing contact patches
 transmit any force wheels steering mechanism would have 
remain attached vehicle about same weight bike
through suspension so wheels transmit forces bike 
same way similar bikes experiment would ride bike along 
 dry road get moving get wheels spinning change 
surfaces something wont transmit forces through contact 
patches try steering manoeuvre see bike leans 
probably would since some us know how easy fall down ice 
 we wouldnt get good idea how well what feels like 
because without contact patches we cant turn maybe theres 
better way besides even ice doesnt get rid contact patch
forces altogether so wed have find really frictionless surface
youd have try again wheels locked really know 
 rotation did 

looking contactpatch effect only however fairly simple
now we have find vehicle gets about same magnitude 
direction cantact patch forces motorcycle transmits them
about same way vehicle without rotating wheels
how gets contact patch forces irrelevant were just looking
 something has contact patches can go straight 
sideways skis skates would do fine i dont know any snowski
 skate bikes up here we have suzuki wetbike arranged
like motorcycle has fat water skis where should wheels
i think propellor front rear ski something like
 we could try coast get rid most its effect
now i admit second hand info although id love try
one review local cycle rag guy 
 bike shop sells them both say machine handles very
much like motorcycle you countersteer turn
so we have contact patches transmit similar forces bikes
 similar suspension arrangement gyroscopes we do have
countersteering

conclusion you dont need gyroscopes countersteer vehicles have
motorcyclelike contact patch arrangements we still dont know what
real effect gyroscopes have when theyre from my observations
 how handlebar angle force etc relate steering general im 
willing bet theyre dominant factor countersteering 

 you dont like conclusion dont accept my motorcycles
behaviour consistent someone can prove otherwise go ahead

ive bike like jody levine dod kv
 got you can you pf jodyplevinehydroonca
