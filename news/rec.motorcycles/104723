 other day raining cats dogs therefor i going only 
 speed limit nothing more my bike guy his bmw 
driving meters behind me meters next red light i
calmly put bike its leg walked back car he rolled down 
window i told him he total idiot reason why

did i do right thing

well i used get mad either try communicate my anger jerks
 uhm educate them how improve manners traffic
now i just try get them off my tail

 heavy traffic i slow down bit mostly so i have more buffer zone 
front balance minimal buffer behind i also often find 
jerk behind notice traffic moving faster other lanes switch
 one them pass me which fine because i can keep 
better eye jerk from behind while looking ahead rather than
from front while splitting my attention between ahead mirrors

 traffic so heavy way jerk pass
i might pull over look street number name
still ignoring jerk just get jerk off my tail 

 all sounds well wimpy undenizenly pessimistic perhaps 
 any psych types passiveaggressive consider i prefer get
my adrenaline jollies from riding rather than from yelling jerks 

 ride can improve my whole day while yelling jerk likely 
me ruin my ride my day my own anger worst case
yelling jerk could ruin my life since even tiny jerk 
cage behind me better armed cage than i am bike 

 other hand you might try subtly arranging last
vehicle legally cross one more intersections leaving jerk
waiting cross traffic thus off your tail crossing
illegally hopefully front waiting police

like almost everything here your choices mileage vary
