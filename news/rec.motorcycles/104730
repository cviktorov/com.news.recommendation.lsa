 watch out often when some scumbag steals cover means
 were looking steal bike my case i
 had faded cover stolen off bmw rrs stashed 
 apartment carport visible from street evidently
 decided beemer wasnt worth stealing did try next night 
 steal honda hurricane parked next apartment building
 neighbor heard them wheeling out called cops


i know just setting myself up actually one 
things really good about bmw bikes from all accounts ive
heard practically one steals bmws probably similar moto
guzzis other relative exotics since isnt large demand
 parts bike would much easier track down seems
 most stolen bikes harleys cc jap sport bikes 

well id say youre mostly right different reasons btw 
couple years ago most stolen bikes orange county sf were 
gsxs ninjas probably biggest reason bmws arent ripped off 
most people who buy bmws only deal actual bmw dealer mail
order types most can have inventory checked fairly easily
 lawenforcement types markup usually sufficient keep 
them honest about acquiring parts 

 harleys ricerockets youve got different situations 
huge aftermarket harley parts so bike can parted out fairly easily
ditto nonsport japanese bikes prices parts 
 high comparatively rockets anytime bike goes down 
plastic usually cracked expensive replace its fairly easy
 disreputable shop take fairing from stolen bike slap 
 bike repair repaint make tidy profit other parts
more traceable can used discarded too traceable
