whenhow do you decide too windy ride

when its too windy stand

when youre road high winds stay alert even more alert
than your alert cause youre motorcycle theyre out kill
you kind alert aware terrain how may funnel
wind sudden gusts well gusts somebody standing 
its gusty cause you ride through you riding steady
crosswind aware hill block wind adjust your
lean angle aware passing trucks your windward side your
lean angle change dramatically both you enter you leave
 turbulance cone reducing your profile may help ie lean 
gas tank kiss triple clamp keep nimble hand 
steering ready countersteer out sudden wind bursts
keep larger than usual buffer zone both ahead behind 
side you can easily blown half lane over before you can react 
countersteering keep close eye traffic your mirror 
someone coming up wanting pass get out way early stop
often short brakes extensive riding high winds both mentally
 physically fatiguing
