 bdc driver nearly rams back innocent biker
 
 i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind car can you
 really actuality avoid incident suggestions

glad hear bozo managed stop ive only been riding 
about two years here my rules traffic light survival

 i try never stop just over hill behind car i have
 stop location i pull almost completely next 
 car front me im only one ie car front i
 turn bike somewhat sideways across lane increase my
 visibility any oncoming vehicle make sure keep your
 taillight visible traffic though note my bike bright
 white turning sideways black bike might beneficial

 flat road i stop bit room ahead me usually
 about two three bike lengths hopefully give
 me room pull forward side car approaches

 you last line vehicles watch your mirrors
 constantly you see vehicle approaching cant see
 any evidence indicate heshe slowing down get out
 way now

 flicker your brake light im last vehicle line i
 pull release brake car approaches from
 behind noticed car watching my mirrors course 
 i vary speed flicker hoping make cager notice
 theres something lane ahead him

now all said its situation where you first line
 i feel most defenseless youre first line your forward escape
route seriously limited you can only move forward extent 
you dont enter intersection i leave some room behind stop line
although around here light activators always right up 
next stop line watch mirrors i think ive decided
 hopping off bike might best way out situation
any other ideas being first line traffic directly behind
you
