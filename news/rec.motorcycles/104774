 question day re passenger helmets you dont know 
certain whos gonna ride you like say you meet them church 
meeting yeah thats ticket what some guidelines should i just 
pick up another shoei my size have backup helmet xl should i 
maybe get inexpensive one smaller size accomodate my likely 
passenger 

 your primary concern protecting passenger event 
crash have him her fitted helmet size your
primary concern complying stupid helmet laws carry real big
spare you can put big small head big helmet 
small one

while shopping passenger helmet i noticed many cases 
external dimensions helmets were same from s through xl 
difference amount inside padding

my solution buy large helmet construct removable liner 
from sheet closedcell foam some satin glued inside
surface result reasonably snug fit my smallestheaded pillion
 liner comfortable fit my largestheaded pillion 
 liner out everyone else gets linered best fit
