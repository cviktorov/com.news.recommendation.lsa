few random thoughts riding passenger

theres substitute bike sufficient power having taken
passengers very occasionally small etc bikes i used 
ride uk hard im now riding gs thats great
even moving from my freinds gsx i riding recently may due
 part fact neither i nor my regular passengers 
particularly slimline 

i always tell passengers stay line bike corners makes
 movements predictable

my regular passengers both tend hold either rack nothing all
i dont really like having passenger hold onto me except short periods
again may biased fact ive had couple new passengers
 friend recently her first time bike who hold me real tight
making any kind maneuvering difficult

ive also discovered longer trips i prefer passenger who moves 
shifts weight bit i recently took work collegue meeting about
 hour ride he sat totally still whole way which left me also
sitting very still getting sore back

we have code system turns stop i need shift position
