 bein themfolk who tend compose fair piece population
bein ones regard bikers loud irresponsible irreverent
reprobate rabble 
sure you didnt rape pillage its relief know you were
 gentlemen because you were completely outofhand you 
justify your lesser indescretions some pretty distorted thinking i
should say 
oh im sorry i just noticed you left mucho bucks money
nevermind my criticism i out line i forgot when one leaves
mucho bucks money behavior permissable perhaps even 
justified

keep mind themfolks ones could give when 
 biker gets killed when elected officials institute further
draconian legislation helmet laws gun controls etc ones dont 
respect our rights roads because we do respect theirs all 
rest time
need i continue

so continue wear your stigma badge next time you 
whining about them effect values yours remember
 probably behavior selfrighteous wusses like myself
 kept them bay long

enjoy
