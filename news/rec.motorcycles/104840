hello folks

im very happy my new rgs my range miles gallons
thats mpg surprisingly bike real cruiser i expecting
something rough shes sweet backroad honey i can go pretty much
anyplace id take my mountain bike far shaft effect its more 
torque effect from crankshaft my opinion rev sitting still
when driveshaft moving bike twists bit maybe
i dont ride her fast enough get shaft effect my opinion
 little buffeting wind far greater consequence okay here 
my questions

 any recommendations homemade fairing id like keep 
wind off my chest perhaps my helmet comfort highway speeds
 mph yet dont want screw up stability b block my
vision too much trail riding anybody have luck twopiece 
detachible fairings id like make myself out plexiglas

 i run two lights standard headlamp plus sidelamp mounted 
crash bar illuminations excellent way full beam coming
out from level motor left side lamp beam linear so
 you get bright streak illumination from left right 
really picks up periphery deer lurking etc combined 
headlamp high you can see like day ive heard bmw alternators
dont crank out too much do i need shut down sidelamp when im
puttering around dirt low rpm 

 embarassing im having trouble starting bike first thing
 morning i invariably flood carbs go read section
 paper she starts right up zen thing 

 haynes manual says do under any circumstances use gasoline
 alcohol additives yeah right what do you folks due keep
 engine carbs from being eaten ethanol methanol any 
particular brands gas best additives

thanks
