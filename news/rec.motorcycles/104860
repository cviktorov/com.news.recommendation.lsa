 well sounds great me when i have real bdi cager tailgating me
 ive found effective strategy flash my brake light 
 pumping pedal you obviously need bit free play your
 brake pedal do seems even most brain dead idiot can
 usually discern flashing red light directly front 
 himherit may mean something wrong

sometimes yes sometimes bdi cagers usually move back 
hyperagressive assholes just move closer something about
testosteronestimulated behavior i think its kinda like waving red
flag bull all all you cant move over let jerk 
its better than nothing
