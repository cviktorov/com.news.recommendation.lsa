hello folks
im very happy my new rgs my range miles gallons
thats mpg surprisingly bike real cruiser i expecting
something rough shes sweet backroad honey i can go pretty much
anyplace id take my mountain bike far shaft effect its more 
torque effect from crankshaft my opinion rev sitting still
when driveshaft moving bike twists bit maybe
i dont ride her fast enough get shaft effect my opinion

 start another shaft effect discussion twist you
feel when revving sitting still due larger flywheels 
 bmw rbikes maybe ks too dunno use you whack throttle
 stop lights itll really rock bike over right

snip snip
 i run two lights standard headlamp plus sidelamp mounted 
crash bar illuminations excellent way full beam coming
out from level motor left side lamp beam linear so
 you get bright streak illumination from left right 
really picks up periphery deer lurking etc combined 
headlamp high you can see like day ive heard bmw alternators
dont crank out too much do i need shut down sidelamp when im
puttering around dirt low rpm 

please post you come any conclusion i am thinking
 putting light each cylinder guard my rs 
wondering whether i going have switch lights off every
time i under rpm
