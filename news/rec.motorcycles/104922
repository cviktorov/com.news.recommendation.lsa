also nc recently last few years decided due fact 
 constantly people road drunk driving raise
 awareness making stricter laws now i believe
nc has toughest laws dwi while necessarily increasing any
amount awareness kills highways meaning its
only made difference sentencing

automatic revocation your license year im sure its 
toughtest law around nc has absolutely sense humor 
respect driving laws anyway i think put you jail sell
your first child slavery passing school bus

 bill breezed through nc house lower intoxification level
from faces stiff opposition senate recently
 highway patrol took few opposition senators out gave
them some shots when hit put them course dodging
cones failed probably change votes result

 some bizarre reason nc only state where governer has 
veto power over legislation coming out state congress so his
opinion matter moot
