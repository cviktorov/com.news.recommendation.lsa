ive never ridden pillion very much recently had excellent 
experience passengering dave edmondson pilot while london 

i found upset bike much less i rode pilot 
 i looked over his shoulder anticipated when i should hold 
hard braking acceleration i tried always look over 
inside shoulder corners move little possible leaving
dave manage me bike he normally would bike 
luggage

hard acceleration can quite unnerving feeling being spit 
off back hard fight similarly i held grab handles
tightly when dave needed brake so mash him pulp im
 lot bigger than he reaching around him pushing off 
tank seemed like would very awkward make even harder 
him manage

 rare occasions when i carry passenger myself i absolutely
refuse carry anyone who properly accoutered riding thats
helmet jacket gloves stout pants shoesboots minimum its 
 my responsibility provide gear its my responsibility
 require want ride

 i agree earlier poster youve had much experience
carrying particular passenger especially youve carried
many passengers before take few gentler rides some duration before
you head off difficult road like minesmt hamilton thats 
nasty place find yourself trouble
