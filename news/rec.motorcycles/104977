 which better onepiece aerostitch twopiece aerostitch



like most everyone else i ended up getting two different sizes 
 top bottom my top l bottom l 
bottom waist far too large thighs fit just right 
 had better waist cut off circulation my legs i have
large muscular thighs i didnt use thighmaster get
them jacket fits me ok chest slightly snug 
waist too small arms i cant imagine finding onepiece
size would have fit correctly even piece has its
problems strange since my vpilot jacket fits great all over 
when i tried matching pants fit like glove well

i can only assume models aero design uses design its suits 
 some way different from us real folks

also even though its related convienience you look pretty damn
wierd walking around tops bottoms while running errands
ive gotten some really suspicious looks sweated lot while 
store wearing whole suit since you cant fit top bottom
 any motorcycle storage device yet devised except trunk my
sidecar rig two piece i unzip pants i generally
leave two pieces zipped together primarily because pants fall
down unless i pull cheesy elastic belttype band real tight
stuff them one my spacious bmw saddlebags pants just fit
 run errands just wearing jacket actually i know ill 
running errands i just wear my vpilot jacket thats just me

 far crash protection id say both suits probably
equal seems weather protection anything piece
provides little more because jacket overlapping pants 
 inches piece probably little less comfortable around
 waist just because extra layer stuff maybe 

so id have vote two piece despite slightly odd fit
i still find suit most versatile piece riding clothing i
own wouldnt go long distance without
