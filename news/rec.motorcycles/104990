get used them didnt happen i tried gazing
 cbs customs each time i sadistically
pictured them being hurled off large precipice

some spoked wheel wonder i shudder feel pity 
 poor soul has suffered enough

why because our wheels repairable

refridgerator box tucked next cx

maytag boxes even after theyve become uninhabitable theyre
make great poor boys mechanics creeper

 milwaukee machine i can actually begin understand
some preaching must hope
