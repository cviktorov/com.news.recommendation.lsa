some potentially cool story stuff here do share details

how get verbal warning 

its simple first has first really nice riding day
 spring bike back together again so you grab
all your gear put fill tank octane premium
 better head out

 ames road leads little town 
gilbert gilbert has one stop light tells you something
having just gotten bike back together i thought id take 
 short ride check things out heading out town i
went twisties slow pace just under speed limit
 started leaning around pace quickened everything felt
just right finally road straightened i ready 
bit speed grab third gear open her up roughly mph
grab fourth gear look much bike you can fail
 notice state trooper following quarter mile behind twist
 throttle like fool grab fifth gear so see
just how well shes been put back together

 according radar i noticed front fender 
flexing bit thus i slowed pulled off road removed my
helmet gloves unslung took kit i carrying fanny
pack just starting tighten fender when trooper
pulled all hot flustered

have you any idea how fast you were going
 precisely i paying attention bike road
 instruments i just got her back together last night 
im just out here testing her out before i ride traffic
my radar says you were over mph care tell me why
i shouldnt give you ticket
because i testing motorcycle away from population 
traffic strait flat road while wearing all protective
gear safety demands note i wasnt quite eloquent
say what kind bike anyway
i eloquent my cafe racer replica honda rat bike
yeah i havent had my bike out garage years
compare riding stories
pack toolkit having tightened fender
so why were you out here
i figure every other idiot road going look right through
me bike fails somehow mph zone im dead holds
up out here i know work right traffic i do 
evvery year when i rebuild her
 any more youll find better place than my highway
 do those speeds i ever catch you speeding my highway
again im going nail you everything i possibly can now get
out my sight before i write you ticket
yes officer

 nutshell how get warning
