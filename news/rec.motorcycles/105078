 i need some advice having someone ride pillion me my ninja
 first time ive taken anyone extended ride
 read farther than around block well riding some twisty 
 fairly bumpy roads mines roadmthamilton loop you sf bay areans
 
 person lbs fairly small so i dont see weight too much
 problem what sort advice should i give her before we go

my fiancee i do quite bit sporty riding up ill tell you 
what weve found systems weve worked out

 starts accelerate much slower than usual its tough rider
 judge how scary fast acceleration because were holding onto something
 leaning forward remember 

 turns have her lean forward same angle you normally 
 means she isnt leaning all its very disconcerting leaned
over have your passenger leaning so theyre sitting straight up
much balance lost can dangerous

 slowing stopping do so much slower than usual again its tough 
 rider judge how scary fast deceleration because were holding 
onto something leaning forward however youll figure out fast
because braking too fast shove passenger forward you which 
shoves you tank inopportune location

 generally have passenger keep her knees against you bike 
out wide helps balance gives her somegrip

 when you passenger fear she squeeze her knees against you
normally means slow down do now 


 turning so she leans me what else traditional
 signals slow down go faster i hafta go pee etc

we only have couple signals slow down her either tapping me 
 back slapping my helmet all her might depends urgency
 matter 

turn here done her pointing direction exit 
also sign cool look i hafta pee same sign
 turn here im hungry same sign go faster usually
done her jumping up down her pegs glee i usually see slow
down more often than go faster
 
 i really want positive experience us both mainly so 
 shell want go me again so any help appreciated

 best thing do before ride talk riding buddy 
pillion his her bike its incredibly frustrating because youre 
 almost control now multiply feeling times ten because
you rider know what your bike do your passenger likely
feel youre about scrape hard parts all time lock up brakes
 any moment go careening off edge volcanic mountain etc 
pillioning yourself good training take somebody your pillion pad

also remember its much more draining tiring ride up
than yourself because youre concentrating much more 
 zen moment less remember
