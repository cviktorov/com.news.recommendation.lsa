okay doders heres goddamn mystery ya 

today i turning degree corner just like any other day 
 slight difference rough spot right my path caused suspension
 compress mid corner some part bike hit ground very
tangible thunk i pulled over first opportunity sus out damage 
my bike kawasaki gpxr footpegs hinged sprung 
 fold upward backward contact ground etc 
lower extreme corner each peg mounted bankfollower 
little stud theoretically first bit hit ground 
banked turn stud mounted footpeg threaded bit about 
mm long which screws threaded hole footpeg now 
mystery

 stud side bike clunked when i turned absent im
fairly sure before event damage end 
 footpeg where stud would ordinarily have been fact thread 
 hole footpeg perfectly intact evidence something
having been forcefully ripped out only moments previously 

okay all you engineering types how fk do you explain how can you
rip tightly fitting steel thread out threaded hole alloy without
damaging thread hole some sort hitech design thingo
 kawasaki never mentioned like end footpeg suddenly
changes phase impact let stud rip out changes back solid
 im quite amazed how could have happened meantime life
goes without lefthand bankfollower
