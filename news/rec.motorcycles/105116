 dog one thats really really stupid large irish setter taught me
 my yard apparently his territory one day im sure he playing 
 game me game probably kill very angry neighbor before 
 he can dispense terrible punishment
 
 what dog weighs lb maybe max you cant handle 

we were having problem instability universal gravitational
constant day closer i got those exposed fangs still dripping
 doubt viscera last foolhardy experimenter cum canine
psychology bigger heavier dog appeared become also 
recall distribution lb one five pound jawteeth 
operated two lb muscles driven ounce brain possessing 
instinctual heuristic composed equal parts bloodlust ravening hunger
 other lb course dog poop varies all over place 
 dog deposits regularly painstakingly manicured tended 
lawns dogs owners neighbors whilst continuously replenishing its
inexhaustible supply doubt consuming likes folks like me

 you have i presume thumbs grapple tear its head
 off

my very thought time i looked down once formidable 
instruments mayhem i realized had become weak atrophied too
many sedentary hours tapping away my ergonomicallycorrect crt keyboard
 only one option left i reached down toolbox near my
car grasped my craftsman ftlb torque wrench surely bludgeon
 dire necessity ever one my amazement 
confusion setter started shaking rolling grass leapt
 its feet vanished down street still quivering occasionally 
looking back me 

seven one blow i exclaimed flexing my newfound biceps brandishing
my terrible weapon invincibility i stalked nowsecure environs
 my domicile only later i found out what dog apparently
knew all along wrench defective would longer measure torque
accurately sears wouldnt fix replace what i had interpreted
 fear subservience were fact unmitigated hilarity contempt

 sheesh even trained attack dog match human
 we have all advantages

exactly nobody can look quite silly we can
