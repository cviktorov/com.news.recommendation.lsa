ed all us argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand

meincluding all ones who think countersteer all way
methrough corner

edwell all way through decreasingradius corner anyway

maybe riding around everdecreasing circle lies which
eventually leads truth



methe official line here though i do have my doubts about 
mefront brake applied first followed rear brake idea being
methat you avoid locking up rear after weight transfer takes place 

 thats official line taught those rider education classes
you were refering also dont teach countersteering i have 
question quality classes 

me too though unfortunately official line one you
have adhere you want get full licence examiners
guidelines laid down government basic rider education
courses have choice follow them surprises me none 
rider groups here either mag bmf make much noise about fact 
 riding test requires you ride three feet from kerb all time
 order pass front brake must applied before rear 
you have keep looking over your shoulder all time instead just
when justified theres probably few more too which i cant
think moment riding test could rejigged bit 
 include more realworld survival skills less 
woefully simplistic crap contains now accident figures
would imho reduce still further

dont think we should include countersteering knowledge our test though
