 i plan switch single fire ignition about month 
 curious anyone has experience supposedly new crane single
 fire competes dynas club wrench wench has
 done dynas modules several friends ill get one also unless
 bunch folks say crane better
 
 one guy just installed mc power arc ignition has yet
 reported results simple boltin replacement new 
 mounting holes had drilled
 
 i recognize its more fun discuss why chris needed change brands 
 penis enhancer how bout some comments single fire ignitions 
 while

i just installed mc power arc ii seems run great i also
used mc coils neither ignition module coils required
any new mounting holes drilled my fxstc little soldering
 all fine static timing real easy set too 

 other side coin my local wrench whose opinion i
invariably seek dont always adopt thinks mc power arc piece
 shit says all them jap chips gonna fail you one day 
needless say he doesnt like any electronic ignition modules 
recommends dynas system i think thats one 
halleffect timing sensors correct
