my first encounter dog chasing after my bike my first poker run
 big german shepard ran out pack bikes i riding tried 
 bite right leg guy riding front me he kicked dog 
couple times we were all only going about mph just made dog
angrier got away applying wfo outrunning dog who started
after yours truly time i had open drag pipes obnoxiously loud hell
 soon dog about feet away from right side my bike i
pulled clutch revved motor up about rpm roar 
 pipes frightened dog away probably made dogs ears hurt like hell
 he didnt come back rest bikers behind me either 

my second encounter already deceased roadkill dog i wasnt paying 
very close attention pavement when car front me straddled 
carcass i looked down just time see what i about run over so i 
just held onto handlebars freaked out both wheels went squarely over
 dogs belly thumpthump just like running over piece x
