quick question

what advantages slipons versus your stock exhaust versus
aftermarket exhaust systems i dont see many people using slipons
 heavily advertised half expensive

thanks
dave


cost lower than oem replacements weigh less also most 
instances you do have rejet carburetors get little more 
performance i replaced my oem canister ontario systems slip 
 midrange performance better i also notice slight stumble 
k rpm after talking kaz yoshima developer manufacturer 
 slip he thinks i might need larger pilot idle jets suppose
 maybe where i live makes difference altitude barometric pressure
anyway besides minor glitch i like slip performance sound
which louder than stock loud enough annoy folks ontario 
slip use some sort sound baffling technique reduce sound full 
throttle

just remember every bike tuned system when you change intake 
exhaust characteristics beyond allowable delta manufacturer you may
have change other areas compensate like complete change exhaust
system header muffler changes exhaust characteristic point
which rejetting required compensate new engine breathingpumping
profile

talk folks who make slip you intend use ask them 
 have used your particular bike check people who have 
system also see what think about slip 

also last data point sport riders first issue did review 
group header exhaust systems cbrf also included 
side bar ontario slip dyno showed increase from stock bhp 
 rear wheel verses 

buyer beware outrageous claimed increases horse power may have been 
true past today
