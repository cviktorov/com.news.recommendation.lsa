required our conferring attentions he came over stood line me 
while we watched her fill out some forms we noticed little kid 
about years old reach over bench touch our helmets one time 
i didnt particularly mind neither did ken kid touching 
our helmets helmets werent most stable 
platforms so ken scooted over resettle them soon he 
touched helmets mother said child started shrieking her kid you 
stay away from those you shit whopped tyke brutally about head
