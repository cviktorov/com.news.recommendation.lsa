 turns out trailer lights were hooked up
 truck 

yep basic rule never expect believe turn signals completely
around here many other places people just dont signal all
 sometimes signals arent working sometimes get left 
 
 scary bit about nonavailability rear
lights all now living netherlands ive learned only
reliable indicators those red ones which go both sides once 
some people call them brake lights once light up expect anything
 occur front you its just dutch though
 
however i never realised how much i relied until i got 
caught few times behind someone whose lights didnt work all once 
id sussed out wasnt so bad knowing half battle 
its great way find out youve been following someone too 
closely now i try check lights all time cos split 
second can make all difference though shouldnt necessary i 
know

what used peeve me canada cars bloody red rear
indicators youd see single red light come think now he
stopping one brakelamp working does he have those dumb bloody
red rear indicators being survival you have assume hes
braking take appropriate actions until time light goes
out again after which you can reasonably certain its bloody red
rear indicator
