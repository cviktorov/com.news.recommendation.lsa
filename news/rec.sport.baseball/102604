i meant one should let exception make rule 

its exception good players come up young most players who come
up young good has always been rule


 most players who come up young always good when theyre young 
later

worse its shift way has always been several
detailed studies have been done theyve all shown players
arent coming up any younger older than past arent 
playing any more less minors than used only thing
 shifts our memories good old days 

damn i afraid you would say 


 all after fact which makes applicable current
discussion which about how you decide whether play rookie who
hasnt established himself majors over mediocre veteran 
padres played santiago year because clearly had nobody else worth
playing 

well perhaps braves had one else worth playing year 
would lopez do have others worth playing 
least opinion i happen agree


both young men were highly touted defensive catchers
expected among best ever baseball 

 recsportbaseball consensus may sound like incredibly
arrogant comment ive found sdcn consensus when one exists
 right far more often than media consensus opinions baseball
people affiliated mlb 

i can believe im newbie here so ill take your word 
alomar fine defensive catcher which my statement above
 solid reason bringing him up tender age long
 feel he can also hit bit lopez does have 
consensus about his defensive prowess imho enough 
give him dreaded seasoning


i dont know who knows i suppose same people similar who
know he better than some other catcher 
course just differing opinions i read his arm 
strong i suppose somewhere some measurement sb ratios
 he still learning call game latter skill may
 difficult project someone without intimate knowledge 
his performance tangible skill

i disagree i dont think tangible skill any more than
leadership i dont deny real skill some catchers
may much better than others i really dont see any way we
could ever know who nicholss law catcher defense eerily
accurate far too often me take defensive assessments catchers very
seriously

sorry new dont know nichols law dont believe catchers
era i am interested pitchers eras different catchers
any info 



absolutely evidence piling up year after year only other
alternative braves really dont know young players
 average better than current starters im ruling out 
kind gross incompetence i think salaryschedule explanation 
more charitable

 other words we know more than do so only logic behind 
 different decision than we would make must financial i presume
we feel way about other franchises than atlanta 


consider we know braves about strongest team baseball
right now even olson lemke nixon bream lineup 
have good chance repeating champs year any team ever has
 actually makes some sense say rather than making our team marginally
better year bringing up young studs dumping elderly lets
go ahead compete year what we have bring up studs
only we have so well still have them under reserve three years
from now beyond when current team collecting pensions

 fair young players does make organizational sense 
i think does

well does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them
 decisions i mean please dont tell me how run my
business especially when im being successful


 ci could make wins you let me bring up lopez

slisten bobby id like way i see he hits
 big club year well paying megaarbitration bucks
down road couple years theres way i want
 do 

 continues 

we can win without him keep winning next year him
hows 

im sure you could right you could also smoking some illegal
substance

hey thats joke dont get offended please


hey id love wrong about you think its unlikely id love
 know why dont cite anybodys innate ethical rectitude though unless
you know them personally


well i cant cite anyones ethical rectitude because i dont know
what means 

 again makes organizational sense so baseball
 business solid business reason keeping
lopez farm thats what braves should do

i happen believe its baseball decision while you from
your armchair may disagee i dont i think lot 
evidence suggest decision made i predicted among
large guffaws from several start spring training i
think very normal decision have made certainly
more reversible than have started lopez bigs have
released one catchers sure may conservative 
may also logical i dont know what ethics have do 
seems like pretty good common sense me
