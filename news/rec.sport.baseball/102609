i watching peter gammons espn last night hes got me little
confused

while talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit
from fringe players theyll facing mcgriff hitting home runs
sheffield getting rbis glavine winning games 
 course all reference what happened other times baseball
has expanded early s late s late s

what really confused me though mention al players who would
do well next year specifically roger clemens winning games 
likes mcgwire gonzalez hitting home runs

my question how hell rockiesmarlins help al 
last time i looked wasnt lot talent jumping leagues did i
miss something

i wondered same thing when he first mentioned i thought he 
just making mistake he said over over 
examples from other years he gave stats players from both leagues even
when only one league expanded

so since stats never lie i guess effect both leagues
because expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making 
every team both leagues dilute major league talent calling up
players normally would have had been expansion

make sense
