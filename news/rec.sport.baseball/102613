 times seems others bullpen used cox middle
relief marvin only pitched innings spring he supposed 
over his surgery i am wondering cox still trying decide who 
use middle relief thinks marvin might his better choice
early season i would immediately give mcmchael many chances 
pitch after spring use bedrock freeman after i am
wondering
how he intends use howell whatever happened senior smoke

 last season exchanged one stiff another berenguer hadnt
come back from his injury i think hes retired now
