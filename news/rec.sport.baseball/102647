i watching peter gammons espn last night hes got me little
confused

while talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit
from fringe players theyll facing mcgriff hitting home runs
sheffield getting rbis glavine winning games 
 course all reference what happened other times baseball
has expanded early s late s late s

what really confused me though mention al players who would
do well next year specifically roger clemens winning games 
likes mcgwire gonzalez hitting home runs

my question how hell rockiesmarlins help al 
last time i looked wasnt lot talent jumping leagues did i
miss something

only you persist believing peter gammons more knowledgable about
baseball than average mailbox okay im overstating still man 
actually had gall say one out every six pitchers nl 
year did pitch majors last year

huh

imo expansion see explosive jump offense 
other expansion drafts had since talent diluted over both leagues
 gammons defense because talent drain came from al well some
increase seen he also gets credit mentioning jump
 offense due also rules changes after season hes still
full
