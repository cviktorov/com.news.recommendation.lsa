javier lopez better catcher than greg olson
ryan klasko better firstbaseman than bream
 chipper jones better shortstop than anyone braves
 put out 

mel nieves better than nixonsanders

thats how forces them play young guys

 i continue amazed comments while lopez might some
 day better catcher than olson i find totally amazing 
 you suggest yearold three seasons professional
 baseball now better than olson fiveyear mlb veteran who 
 noted his ability call game who has betterthanaverage
 arm oh perhaps you talking about hitting well sure lopez
 might hit better perhaps he probably 
 
 has ever history baseball been yearold 
 younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league
 catchers terms defense brought bat wasnt 

yes ivan rodriguez last year batted threw out 
baserunners too shabby rookie from aa years old last
year

 sandy alomar who supposed good his rookie year
 wasnt benito santiago who supposed good
 his rookie year 
 
 i can continue thread others mentioned you get
 point you others seem so quick dismiss 
 seasoned veterans favor hot young rookies perhaps 
 just perhaps management team pennantwinning braves
 knows something more than you do perhaps what know 
 very very few year old rookies come up majors
 make impact
