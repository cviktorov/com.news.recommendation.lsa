we know very very few players age make much impact
 bigs especially when havent even played aaa ball 

yes irrelevant youre talking about averages when we
have lots information about player particular base our
decisions 

i might well say we know very very few people more than feet
tall so chances manute bol really only foot 

 maybe i need improve my writing skills lopez who very
ordinary defensively likely hit so well age 
having played aaa level probably good idea
 rush him braves lineup 

why isnt lopez likely hit well he hit well last year after
adjusting his stats park league he hit better 
absolute scale than olson berryhill did lot

 rushing really qualitative difference between 
minors majors requires period adjustment i dont
believe wouldnt you rather waste lopezs year old good
season than his year old very good season his yearold excellent
season sooner you get him acclimated more his prime you get 
use

lopez hitting over ab when he cut from spring
training what does he have do earn chance maybe full
time job least couple starts few ab him prove
his worth

gee i dont know abs sounds pretty good me about good
 your reasoning kid should play backup role rather
than start every day aaa talk about me gm

 point ab significant sample rather he
hadnt done anything spring training cause even blockhead manager
 question whether his minor league numbers were real send him
down until he gets warmed up

ok most players ready bigs age 

most players never ready bigs what does have do
 javy lopez

most players 
benefit rather than being stagnant hurt playing aaa

see above 

most catchers need solid defensively players help 
clubs bigs those arguments against lopez 
braves year

 i could apply same reasoning frank thomas barry bonds most
players arent good so probably wont good year
either

now braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities call games work pitchers throw out
runners 

 demonstrated inabilities hit way out soap bubble

 superstars mind you solid experienced veterans

 superstars stars even good players maybe average were
being charitable

 braves have very solid lineup two big bats 
outfield excellent platoon first solid mvp candidate
 third one better hitting shortstops 

ummm justice very fine hitter pendleton might have another big year
 his bat he might also spend season hamstring hell gant 
big question mark breamhunter platoon decent excellent 
has rotten obp slg depending whos blauser very valuable
bat shortstop


 center
field platoon probably hit however good lopez
bat might given above wont so much better than
what have offset differential experience 
defensive ability 

wanna bet difference between lopezs bat olsonberryhill could 
 runs over course season given choice between player
 experience player who can play ill take latter every time

 kid improve playing aaa 

just like keith mitchell did

i am just so surprised i have spell all out my 
goodness do you believe other poster who thinks lopez
 being held down because his future earning potential

 me you so far your only counterproposal 
really dont understand how good lopez overvalue experience
 some combination two i think my interpretation more
flattering organization

 idiots who have built ballclub
