we know very very few players age make much impact
 bigs especially when havent even played aaa ball 

yes irrelevant youre talking about averages when we
have lots information about player particular base our
decisions 

do you really have much information him really

why isnt lopez likely hit well he hit well last year after
adjusting his stats park league he hit better 
absolute scale than olson berryhill did lot

i dont know you tell me what percentage players reach 
exceed mles rookie season were talking about
 you know


 rushing really qualitative difference between 
minors majors requires period adjustment i dont
believe wouldnt you rather waste lopezs year old good
season than his year old very good season his yearold excellent
season sooner you get him acclimated more his prime you get 
use

 were your purpose maybe offerman spent getting 
acclimated you dodgers team paid big price
 season perhaps reap benefits down road
do you really think would have done what did 
were competing pennant


lopez hitting over ab when he cut from spring
training what does he have do earn chance maybe full
time job least couple starts few ab him prove
his worth

 point ab significant sample rather he
hadnt done anything spring training cause even blockhead manager
 question whether his minor league numbers were real send him
down until he gets warmed up

 stathead im amazed you put any credence spring
training did you notice who he got those hits off 
 you going tell me doesnt make difference

 kid improve playing aaa 

just like keith mitchell did

wait minute i missed something here first forget keith
mitchell you saying kid who moves from aa aaa
 does improve would have been better off making 
direct leap majors player does well aa 
does improve aaa isnt sign maybe he doesnt
belong bigs

now keith mitchell i recall stat books handy surprise
he jumped from aa atlanta he did so well he 
returned minors where he didnt do very well all now
his career jeopardy so how does he fit your 
point good mles aa moved him right big club now
hes one step away from being traded moved out baseball
duh


 me you so far your only counterproposal 
really dont understand how good lopez overvalue experience
 some combination two i think my interpretation more
flattering organization

well ive cast my lot certainly you may understand better how 
good lopez i may overvalue experience neither one
 us runs baseball team
