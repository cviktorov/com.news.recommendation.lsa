 rushing really qualitative difference between 
minors majors requires period adjustment i dont
believe wouldnt you rather waste lopezs year old good
season than his year old very good season his yearold excellent
season sooner you get him acclimated more his prime you get 
use

can anybody name player who rushed majors lets 
arguments sake define rushed brought up majors more than
 cup coffee prior age younger performing below
expectations whose career damaged rushing im serious i
tend agree david bringing player up sooner better 
id like look players whom theory didnt work 
any id prefer players within last years so because i can
look up minor league stats its important distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what minor league numbers
would have projected opposed players who were hyped failed 
actually had careers out line minor league numbers 

lets kick off example player who rushed although
 doesnt seem have been any damage his career jay bell 
given pas major leagues age performed well below what
you would expect from his aaa numbers same season he got pas 
next year age still underperformed however next year 
age his performance improved he won everyday shortstop job
 has been ever since its really hard me see where he
would have been better off staying minor league where he 
performed quite well aaa during time rather than being rushed
cleveland might have been better off i suppose because might have
been less likely give up him

yes you bring player up early hes likely going struggle 
does delay time which he stops struggling starts
performing up expectations
