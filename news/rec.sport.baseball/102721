can anybody name player who rushed majors lets 
arguments sake define rushed brought up majors more than
 cup coffee prior age younger performing below
expectations whose career damaged rushing 

i tend agree players hurt early play big leagues
 braves organization fertile ground test hypothesis 
had little talent roster some time steve avery example
 rushed majors he fared very poorly during his initial campaign
his subsequent pitching has been affected his era during his rookie
year bill james pointed out relatively unusual struggle so
 rebound

bob horner also rushed majors out arizona state directly had
good numbers immediately

i am certain ages people like pete smith craig mcmurty 
derek lilliquist braves pitching staffs were so bad when came up
 might have been rushed lilliquist smith struggled 
didnt hurt ps dl may have been overhyped i seem recall cm pitching
well initially though i dont have stats handy
