most catchers need solid defensively players help 
clubs bigs those arguments against lopez 
braves year

now braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities call games work pitchers throw out
runners 

 crux argument me least both 
sdcn nonsdcn camps seem agree fact catchers
defense basically nonmeasurable present you can talk about how
important calling game framing pitches blocking balls
 dirt little way tell exactly how various
catchers rank defense 

looking lopez specifically any reason suspect
 he bad defensive catcher other fact braves
 media has labeled him bad defensive catcher far i
can tell he doesnt have any particular problem his mechanics
 sasser he might little rough around edges blocking
 ball framing pitch get good call all he needs 
clear up playing practice time i cant see how repetitions
 aaa any better reps majors 

all were left calling game aspect olsen 
berryhill always given credit calling good games helping
 pitchering staff reputation given almost
all veteran catchers how catching aaa going help lopez learn
 major league pitching staff only way any catcher going 
learn tom glavines pitches catch tom glavine similarly i wouldnt
 supprised pitchers claimed prefer pitching olsen over
pitching lopez because used pitching olsen 
given time say comfortable lopez

now since lopez cant learn how handle major league
pitchers while hes aaa since he doesnt have any glaring
problem his mechanics what he going learn aaa he
cant learn just well while majors
