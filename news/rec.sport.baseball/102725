 since i did so well last year heres another shot picking winners
 losers ill skip commentary why i picked who finish where
 due lack time flame wars 
 
 
 kansas city
 
 i think kc has much better shot being top division than
 bottom one wordcone should help things tremendously i think
 you way off mark here

another word offense makes them my pick last too
well theres also my policy never picking buck rodgers team last

 florida
 chicago
 
 i dont know expansion team has ever finished last i think
 year might first hasnt ever happened cubs worse

 angels were game out th athletics 
expansion senators finished tied last 
 colt s finshed th ahead cubs mets were last
 royals finshed th ahead white sox pilots last
 mariners finished th ahead athleticsin last

apparently being expansion team poor chicago 
team around good thing

 national league west
 
 cincinnati 
 houston 
 atlanta 
 argh here where you obviously dead wrong since yankees 
 s s has team been so nicely setup yearsand years 
 come braves i dont think allstar team able beat 

 may appropriate comparison
 yankees finshed nd rd nd finshing 
 games out first 
 also finished second though were only
 games out
even great teams can lose thats why play season
 other hand im still picking braves go all way
