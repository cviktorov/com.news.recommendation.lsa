every single piece evidence we can find points major league baseball
being offense defense run scored just important run
prevented 

 course run scored just important run prevented
just penny saved penny earned enough cliches

its cliche unlike your comments below its tautology
 neednt have been true every pitcher baseball were essentially
 same quality ie variance pitching ability were much
smaller than variance batting ability scoring runs would 
much more important than preventing them simply because ability 
actively prevent runs would much weaker

my point braves starters able live up 
 potential wont need much offensive support

 thats your point you should have said so what you fact said 
pitching defense win championships later pitching essence
 baseball neither which says what you now claiming your 
point neither which true

 seems me when quality pitchers take 
mound other teams score less runs team scores most 
runs wins 

 you accuse sherri mouthing cliches

 puts team better pitching advantage
providing can stop opposing team from scoring runs low 
scoring game would clearly benefit braves 

its clear me all true highscoring games 
team better offense wins high percentage time low
scoring games split essentially regardless team ability

 should have many 
low scoring games due excellent pitching below average hitting
 flip side you had starting lineup great offensive players
i would arguing team would need great pitchers

i thought you said pitching defense win championships pitching 
 essence baseball
