joe torre has worst manager baseball

hes greatest true

 anyone who didnt see sundays game

i saw 

 right hander pitching he decides bench lankform left handed
hitter play jordan gilkey both right handers

lankford hurt although announcer said he told torre he
could pinch hit needed him 

later ninth inning bases loaded two outs he puts
lankford hitter power pinch runner uses luis
alicea hitter power pinch hitter what hell
 he thinking

i wondered same thing giving joe benefit 
doubt id say he thinking lankford hurt enough 
he didnt trust his ability bat effectively he wants his
speed bases so pinch run him alicea i completely
confused about maybe he had good record hitting against 
particular pitcher i dont know anybody got idea

earlier game interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented
how fortunate cardinals were get whiten whiten would 
regular even though meant gilkey would hurt torre said
he liked gilkey coming off bench gilkey hit over last year
what does he have do start guy would starting most every
team league

well so far i havent seen much say whiten shouldnt playing
 too bad gilkey odd man out when play 
jordan ahead him i dont quite understand

furthermore sundays game when lankford thrown out plate 
 replay showed bucky dent third base coach looking down line
 waving lankford home 

yup i looked replay too im joe torre im
going have talk bucky after game one hes
got lankford third todd zeile i believe hot hitter 
coming up theres reason risk giving lankford go sign 
 situation unless he sure ball going stands 
its his job watch play develop he should have known larkin 
 back up bad throw seemed inexcusable my book 
btw i saw dent do same thing last year zeile rounding third 
 going sure out home critical situation 
replay theres dent waving him around looks like might 
serious problem cards werent good base runners all last year 
 i wonder how much fault lies base coaching


i cant take anymore

well im still hanging 

go redbirds woof woof
