honestly ozzie smith robin yount dont belong theyre both

shortstops just hung around long time big deal

 you real how many gold gloves does ozzie smith have 
guy hung around hit homers year years wouldnt he
 given hall defense just important 
robin yount couldnt hit why would he have stuck around long enough
 get hits you saying hits fluke 
hits big deal 

 lets little more selective huh stop handing out honors
so

liberally save them guys who really deserve face 
something

isnt done little prestige hall fame anymore when

certain individuals believe steve garvey jack morris potential

candidates absurdity apparent gee can guys even compare 
i agree garvey morris dont deserve 

 more likely future hall famers like kirby puckett nolan ryan

well based your argument nolan ryan doesnt deserve hall 
fame he just right hander who stuck around long time
 could throw hard very few game winning seasons lots 
losing seasons lots walks cy young awards how does nolan
ryan compare guy like steve carlton who dominated major
league seasons won divisons world series won half his
teams games he doesnt compare even close

kirby puckett hasnt done long enough me give me more
seasons like hes been having ill think about
