 those people who do know what press like
 new york probably more cutthroat than just about
any other part us keith hernandez said very well 
espn couple days ago would much rather mention 
clubhouse fight than tworun homer ninth win 
game i do read klapischs news columns regularly i
do know he has been accused before being instigator
 enjoys hopefully only professional reasons drumb
up news story even isnt one now far 
 confrontation bobby bonilla few days ago i almost
totally blame bonilla matter what member press
does matter how much putrid individual he might
 does give ballplayer right threaten 
journalist 
personally i always thought beat writer 
always follows club around should report news 
looking degrade team i dont know whether blame
klapisch because may only way keep job new
