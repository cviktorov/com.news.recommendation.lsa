ive recently been working project determine greatest
players respective postions my sources total baseball
james historical abstract ballplayers biography word 
mouth my own biased opinions

feel free comment suggest flame whateverbut i tried
 objective possible using statistical data inlcuded
 timeconviences sake i judged rel ba adj ops total average
fielding rangeruns total player rating total baseball stolen bases
 curiositys sake tpr g years playedmvp

b
 mike schmidt
 ed matthews
one t eddie mathews
 george brett
 wade boggs
 ron santo
 brooks robinson
 frank baker
 darrell evans
 pie traynor
 ray dandridge

how can brooks i think he would least ahead ron santo

because small advantage fielding ability comes nowhere near
making up large difference hitting average
seasons using combined average ab bb per games

 years ab h r b b hr rbi tb bb avg obp slg ops
santo 
robinson 

fielding we have per games third

 years p dp e pct
santo 
robinson 

even robinsons extra putouts assists dps taken mean
he responsible more outs field doesnt make up
 extra outs he made plate mention fewer
total bases difference ops should decreased about
 account wrigley difference still considerable
 thorn palmer ratings 

 adjusted adjusted stolen fielding total
 production batting runs base runs runs rating
santo 
robinson 
usual disclaimers about tps fr apply really shouldnt 
way off mark comparison least its better than fielding
percentage carney lansford has th best alltime fr
dead last all time also since total rating compares players
 league average instead replacement level robinson should 
awarded extra so playing more games he had great
career i would prefer santos plus years replacement level bman

 i would knock traynor off list replace him stan hack
thats similar story hacks far better hitting outweighs traynors
superior fielding graig nettles buddy bell would also better
choices imho course though some recent net discussion supports
 point view

cf
 andre dawson

shouldnt right field
