jack morris starts have been like his playoff starts he has era 
 his starts

what does luck have do era he lucky get wins
last year he had era team scored lot 
runs i would happy he could still pitch era 
he seems suffering from total callapse 

bad pitchers more prone total collapse than good pitchers
 closer chasm mediocrity smallest push 
 completely lose grip

 good ones can collapse somewhat come back next year
burleigh grimes went from wins era so 
 era around he pitched well several more years carlton
won lost year after his record source bill james
historical baseball abstract
 lets forget john tudor who started finished 
 he had pretty bad era when you take busch stadium account 
 start season

he gave up early runs
 his games would get stronger game went thus giving
up few runs last going he stays game gets win
how else would he have pitched so many innings

yup he used dig himself hole get together stick 
until run support eventually came through year he just
hasnt gotten together

 i recall he had era st half era 
nd half last year 
 hmmm runs innings suppose he starts more games winds
up w innings pitched he allows runs game next 
innings hell have era so end year i think i have
his totals right going hard come back from

jack may finished time retire released he does
 return his form from last year

his million contract awful lot eat

 my st hunch morris very gutsy he may pitching
through injury telling anyone my nd guess he 
banished bullpen remainder season after few more starts
perhaps when stewart comes off dl danny cox who went 
scoreless innings against tribe today start morris he looks like
 really good one gaston scrambling find starters id imagine
luckily jays have very good offense
 i dont think would dare release him before end year
hell just replaced stewart cox
 
doug fowler dxfpocwruedu me age now mommys daddys other

missed rd strike poem support cause heaven just great
he ran first made big hug lasts forever ever
