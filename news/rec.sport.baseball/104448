ive been saying quite some time being absent from 
net while i figured id stick my neck out bit

 royals set record fewest runs scored al
team since inception dh rule ps any ideas what 

 fall easily short runs thats damn sure i cant
believe media fools picking them win division like our
tom gage detroit news claiming herk robinson some kind 
genius tradesaquisitions hes made

 would you say same thing about dodgers true
cone probably good drysdale have koufax still
 teams were winning home run leaders who had very bad totals 
lots lowscoring games etc didnt use relievers whereas
jeff montgomery having super season them
 being said i still picked them th so i think superb
pitching team can win have enough hitting theres more 
chance i think than team tremendous hitting 
pitching least me
 i wonder though which one do you people think would do better team
 johnson koufax his prime seaver carlton young real
order starters sutter fingers lyle bullpen 
 puny offense assuming good defense like mazeroski maranville etc
 team poor pitching offense cobb carew ruth gehrig
mays schmidt wagner bench againyou pick order
 i would postulate pitching one would several games better 
seasons end even best hitters can succeed only time 
 best years great pitcher can throw lots shutouts taking all
 players prime might throw shutouts year all
 offense would have do get run across
 i wonder someone stratomatic something could plug all
time teams regular season have played report results
i would love see 
 
doug fowler dxfpocwruedu me age now mommys daddys other
 ever wonder after casey relatives have give lots hugs love
missed rd strike poem support cause heaven just great
he ran first made big hug lasts forever ever
