so far simmons looks like total idiot


 zane smith should learn how switchpitch return from dl i
would rather have zane smith pitch right handed than have moeller pitch all

 i am sure simmons ready say i told you so after otto had 
impressive win last week now ottos latest debacle has restored simmons
reputation now he looks like he back his form when he had 
als highest era among starters four our sakenot teds sake i hope he
pitches era rest season yeah right

 tomlin merced bit disappointing still doing decently
 considering considerable amount talent maturity have
shown first seasons seem have actually gotten little
bit worse tomlin almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters
merced had very good oba his rookie year he showed lot concentration 
 plate his rookie year

 walk well he seems losing end tonight i still think 
walk desrved his contract

 leyland should accept part blame lavalliere situation i
cant understand his managements fear losing tom prince through
waivers even do whats use he aright hander like slaught
 very smart platoon also i am blaming leyland case since he hcurrently convinced lavalliere through while giving him
way too much time last year regular season playoffsslaught
should have played all games he has good average against right handed
pitching didnt leyland simmons forsee last year attempt 
trade lavalliere last year itself any fool could tell them lavalliere
wasnt very fit last year

 dennis moeller scary
 candeleria well he going have high era end 
season maybe range million plus come other
than customary home run giving stage patterson goes through few weeks
patterson has served pirates very well each year so far he seems have
pitched well rangers i think pirates should have spent money
 patterson stead

 rookie batters well young has surprised me bit his instant impact other than excellent performance hasnt been too much surprise i think we should thank doughty 

 rookie pitchers worse than expected especially cooke
 slaught how come he wasnt given contract extension last year now his
value has increased immensely

 lonnie smith well eric davis signed comparable amount
lets see eric can hit better he can run better he can field better
now why didnt pirates go after eric davis injured davis better
than healthy lonnie smith even lonnnie smith gets some big hits yearhe wont asset he has looked terrible bases field

 management big big zero sauer has yet make forceful agreement
 favor revenue sharing he seems more concerned about pleasing 
idiot danforth preparing team move tampa bay
 alex cole fiasco pirates infield cf positions look good 
rf lf would have looked good we could have gotten cole replace
two four outfielders eric davis van slyke cole would have made 
very respectable outfield even without eric davis thye pirates would have
 respectable outfield cole svan slyke mercedi think he should hit
left handed against lefts stead switch hitting simmons did have options
 outfield ironically biggest accomplishment simmons tenure 
getting alex cole really cheap too bad

 compensatory draft picks bonds forget pirates can rant rave
 get those picks now issue still being appealed
now doesnt convince anyone simmons sauer idiots
nothing else 

 final note tim wakefield wont awful he his last 
starts dont count him pitching like last year rest 
 season also pirates contention towards rthe end 
season miss reduss clutch hitting his speedhe has peaked
 second half last seasons
