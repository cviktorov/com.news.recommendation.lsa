so far simmons looks like total idiot

 leyland should accept part blame lavalliere situation i
cant understand his managements fear losing tom prince through
waivers even do whats use he aright hander like slaught
 very smart platoon also i am blaming leyland case since he hcurrently convinced lavalliere through while giving him
way too much time last year regular season playoffsslaught
should have played all games he has good average against right handed
pitching didnt leyland simmons forsee last year attempt 
trade lavalliere last year itself any fool could tell them lavalliere
wasnt very fit last year

sorry biggest load bunk ive seen while 
 pirates have been trying trade lavalliere some time now
nobody even vaguely interested
b several other teams had made known would grab prince
who out options
c lavallieres release had nothing do him being through he
 released because event injury slaught
lavalliere longer capable believe being everyday
catcher

since slaught good against righties he against lefties
 offense should actually improve move

toby
