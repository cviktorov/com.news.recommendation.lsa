ted youre missing vital point roger lustig pointed out 
previous response reason why schott banned from baseball 
because she had been known call think racially biased manner 
 constant basis thoughts affected her hiring practices bonilla
 other hand found have mentioned one word single time
 he had been known go around criticizing homosexuals would 
different story furthermore he merely athlete he doesnt have 
hire anyone schott had do dave pallone former nl umpire who 
 admitted homosexual has decided assist protest before mets
game shea he like you thinks bonilla should suspended from
baseball pallone hoping years suspension my opinion
thats downright ludicrous howie rose wfan said you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned derogatory word even single time
under whatever conditions youd probably have enough people remaining
 play threeonthree game now honestly you truly analyze 
differences between two cases you bring up your article i
would think youd reconsider your thoughts
