has jack lost bit his edge what worst start jack morris has had

uh jack lost his edge about years ago has had only one above
average year last 

again goes prove better good than lucky you can
count good tomorrow lucky seems prone bad starts 
bad finish last year 

yes i am enjoying every last run he gives up who who said
morris better signing than viola

cheers
valentine

hey valentine i dont see boston any world series rings 
fingers damn morris now has three probably hall fame his 
future therefore i would have say toronto easily made best 
signing dont tell me boston win year wont 
even top division more like th

shawn


gee i never knew valentine made comment about how viola signing
 boston gonna bring world series title boston i dont
think valentine ever said boston win year boy talk about
sensitive insecure toronto fans 

 any case i think viola would have made better signing why
viola younger left handed how many left handed starters does
toronto have
