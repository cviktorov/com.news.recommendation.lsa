 any case i think viola would have made better signing why
 viola younger left handed how many left handed starters does
 toronto have

well i agree viola better signing however why does
everyone say you want lefthanded starters i understand lefthanded
spot relievers even though usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters i just dont understand why people insist
 lefthanded starters unless park effect eg yankee stadium
most batters mlb righthanded so righthanded starters have
 platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters
i guess one argument lefty starters certain teams
may more vulnerable lhps than rhps however probably
only factor postseason because teams seldom juggle starters
 reason during regular season

i think you just want best starters you can get regardless 
whether lefties righties lefthanded starters tend have
higher eras than righthanded starters precisely because managers
go out way start inferior lefties perhaps because 
 platoon advantage

am i missing something here
