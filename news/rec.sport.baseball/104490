 only really valid retort valentine werent red sox trying
 get morris too oh sure said viola first choice
afterwards what should we have expected would say

lou wanted morris all along idiot giving man million
 play like giving five year old loaded uzi 
safety off only question how many shots he get off
before somebody wise enough take away

 dont tell me boston win year wont 
 even top division more like th

 true wont lack contribution viola so who cares

i dont see why people expect boston finish sixth bottom four
teams last year were essentially tied boston seventh place had
 wins yankees indians tied fourth place had wins

now i should think obvious red sox improved more than
 indians tigers basically red sox stronger year
 b dh ss lf rf have healthier starting pitchers so
far least better relievers i see reason why 
shouldnt win games meanwhile indians shambles 
 tigers still have pitching win some 
blowouts lose awful lot games too

maybe sox play poorly win games finish fifth
 i think third fourth place more likely

cheers
valentine
