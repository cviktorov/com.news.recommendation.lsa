dont you guys think so i mean cmon what heck women doing
even thinking getting baseball cause so many problems just

assuming youre serious i guess youd surprised hear
 us guys dont think so i would guess tiny fraction
 folks reading your post agree i kind 
doubt even you agree 

im going go through your points one time because 
after all many them have anything all do baseball

im only replying because you brought up pam postema 
aaa umpire who sued suing baseball grounds sex
discrimination because she wasnt promoted majors

jeez look pam postema just because shes woman everybody 
face earth thinks its great shes getting opportunity 
ump you even watched games had iq greater than 
roast beef youd see she nearly good most aaa umpires

ive never seen her ump game i have first hand experience
 her ability umpire

 i have seen her talk shows her point seems 
 she can call balls strikes well any 
umpires she knows rulebook better than most seems
 me she missing point thats how she sees
 role umpires game well i wouldnt promote her
either

 umpires primary role has nothing do calling baserunners
safe out hell joe lundy could do primary function 
 maintain order game keep game moving keep 
players from trying kill each other 

umpires have extremely tough people disqualifies most
 us both men women ms postema thinks she
deserves major league umpire because her command 
 rulebook i think disqualifies her well umpires
need command game command rulebook secondary
