dodgers have been shopping harris other teams 
quest more lefthanded pitching so far takers
personally i think harris defensive liability he
has also led team past years hitting double
plays least been among leaders
 
sharperson showed last year given chance play
every day he can get job done sharpy played just
one base every day say third hed also improve defensively
 
wallach has helped tremendously defense has reed
 improved defense quite noticeable having 
effect pitching staff both astacio martinez
were bailed out recent starts great defensive plays
martinez pitched ninth game might
have seen him lifted third past years
 
astacio lasted innings other day under similar circumstances
 dodgers turning double plays keeping more balls
 infield than last year piazza has also been great
 defense he has thrown out batters trying 
steal has least one pick off first
 
wallach clearly has contributed over all improvement 
defense his offense awful he has cost dodgers
some runs i dont think he bad his current average
i suspect he come out slump much davis straw
seem have come out theirs
