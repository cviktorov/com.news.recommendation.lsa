my question you all why does media seem embrace theme 
death baseball so strongly i have seen articles similar vein 
 chicago tribune sports editorials tv

maybe because baseball only business where those who 
responsible fiscal aspects game preach gloom doom 
 allegedly intelligent people seem predict bad times losing
money bankruptcies alarming rate theres going 
increased degradation product produce could you imagine
ibm all problems promoting themselves way major league
baseball does stock would plummet unthinkable depths 
 too far from now what would happen gm where
would gm admitted cutting corners producing 
inferior product because alleged labor problems i think shows 
lack confidence people who run game

anyway just frustrates me when media says things because 
inevitably leads owners trying quick fixes like increasing playoffs 
satisfy television trying interleague play drum up interest 

forget word has three divisions wild card just about
 done deal has decided soon since negotiations 
networks also have begin soon
