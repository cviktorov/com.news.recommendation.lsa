heres my analysis jose canseco circa sep jose canseco
circa june 

 hes bulked up too much period he needs lose about pounds
 gain more bulk

ive been saying least years now even conditioning
guru told jose he carrying too much weight losing some would help
his backalthough i dont one second believe jose used steroidshis
back problems very similar problems alot steroid users experience
because simply carrying too much weight framesee jeff
bregel ex er textbook example imho jose too big his
frame


 his bat speed has absolutely vanished conservatively id say hes
 lost his bat speed thats huge amount speed

i cant imagine how estimate bat speed its pretty obvious 
jose missing fastballs he used hit likely due his back


 open stance killing him note he acts sort like
 brian downing way open start closes up ball 
 released downing could do without significant head movement 
 canseco cant also note canseco doesnt always close his
 stance same way sometimes his hips open sometimes
 theyre fully closed without good starting point its hard
 make adjustments your swing

i dont know he had even more open stance when he first came up 
 had problems might preback
problems he quick enough cover up any deficiencies stance
caused now hes lost just enough bat speed stance hurts
him old saying youre hot its trigger mechanism youre
cold its hitch 

first minimize movement before swing close widen stance
 severely cut down stride i take my swing hopefully 
 cut down time i need swing allow me move
 bathead more freely

 biggest problem imho he never has found stance hes comfortable
 more than few months he changes his stance so much he loses
track where strike zone wednesdays night game he 
clearly mad strike calls both corners looked pretty good 
me i think he longer knows where strike zone really because
hes changed his stance so much

im also bit concerned because hes got palmer gonzalez hitting
all homeruns hell become competitive swing even harder screw
himself up even worse larussa always said cansecos famous batting
practice homer shows did him more harm than good encouraged
bad hitting habits
