 i would tend call offensive contributions even alomar wins hands
 down defensive capabilities im just talking about number 
 errors nobody including lind has range athleticism second base
 i cant recall recent past anyone turning double play better
 than alomar 

well why dont you look up those stats baerga may best defensive
second baseman league hes damn good check stats dps
last year see yourself

according defensive average stats posted sherri baerga had 
highest percentage dps turned league while alomar had worst
however alomar had higher defensive average so who would better

using alomars opportunities groundballs possible double plays
alomar had groundouts turned dps
baerga would have had same da dp groundouts dps

using baergas opportunites groundballs possible double plays
alomar would have had same da dp groundouts dps
baerga had groundouts dps

baerga looks better though its possible his dp would lower 
different ss

 baerga consistently turn twice many double plays however alomar
has established high level defense baerga has i would bet 
alomar better next year last year baerga just good overall
