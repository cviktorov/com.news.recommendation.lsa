 course left rbis off were comparing alomar individual 
 baerga individual so only individual stats count 

i forgot most runs scored players stealing home so rbi dont
count anything

uh right you also forgot you cant get rbi barring hr 
nobody base what fraction all runs come solo hr

most runs scored because happened players base when 
batter did something good i use phrase happened advisedly
lots people have tried figure out who players who have 
most ability turn up notch clutchrbiwhatever situations 
what theyve found evidence anyone has 
ability any measurable extent clutch hitters people who
tend do things would cause rbi were somebody base
end up getting rbis proportional how many teammates obliged 
being position 

my mistake

i agree

me too rbi worthless stat course so stolen bases because 
sometimes runners front player would otherwise run 
course pitchers pitch differently different people different bases
so batting average slugging obp out too hmmm i guess homers would
 count either
my point rbi might perfect stat nothing stat lack
 can tell me clutch hitters maybe stat can tell me
either some people i just know
