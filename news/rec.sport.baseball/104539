 hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves 
 i
 
 mean heck dave winfield hohum seriously being considered 
 
 
 lee smith ha why dont we give dave kingman chance darrell
 
 evans yeah yeah after hall fame takes them can take 
 eddie
 
 murray jeff reardon

i am trying think how respond without involving personal feeling
 perceptions i can without having stats back up my points
however i think you approached wrong way i believe all 
people mentioned here deserve hall fame more than dave kingman does i
feel were all much better players i am saying i fell deserve 
go would deserve more 

imho 
dave kingman definately guy only had couple years were he
could hit atleast respectable averag rest his career i do 
think he very feared pitchers i also do think he did lot 
game i mean really i am met fan he met part his career i
still would back him hall fame

dave winfield i think so he feared pitchers he has had several
season where he hit respectable average his production numbers 
 my opinion without stats better than kingmans probably quite 
bit i also perceive him leader maybe much some other
people none less leader i think he has made substantial
contributions game baseball society examples 
some charitable things he has done i know some from when he
 yankees i think he type player kids can look up 
 while definately only criteria hall fame i
think deserves some consideration

lee smith maybe i would have see his stats again he definately would
deserve go before likes kingman

darrell evans 

eddie murray maybe he has had very good career he leader although
 silent one he good role model stats good enough i am 
sure i would once again believe much better than kingmans both
 average well power numbers good winfields just
think eddie did have much publicity most his great years

jeff reardon my guess kind depends his numbers off 
top my head i would take lee smith first

 
 well any case i am sick tired mostly sick everybody
 giving
 
 hall fame consideration players todays standards
 marginal
 
 honestly ozzie smith robin yount dont belong theyre both
 
 shortstops just hung around long time big deal
 

well i strongly disagree here both guys deserve sure i
talked about leadership above both guys leaders have been
instumental leading teams post season robin does have very
good offensive numbers both average power ozzie has okay numbers
offensively difference ozzie you gave him home run 
every run he saved making incredible play shortstop he would have
shattered aarons home run mark now how many those great plays saved
games how many those great plays motivated his team rally win 
game while i believe both guys have numbers baseball about more
than numbers least winning baseball about more than numbers
both guys proven stars belong hall fame does
george brett who also belongs class player

 lets little more selective huh stop handing out honors
 so
 
 liberally save them guys who really deserve face 
 something
 
 isnt done little prestige hall fame anymore when
 
 certain individuals believe steve garvey jack morris potential
 
 candidates absurdity apparent gee can guys even compare 
 
 more likely future hall famers like kirby puckett nolan ryan
 

steve garvey i am sure probably i guess i could see someone
making case him 

jack morris once again my first choice i can see why someone might
bring up his name

kirby puckett probably only reason i do say definately he still
has time left his career he continues doing what he has been my
probably turn definately

nolan ryan really any doubt i think i heard something about him
having some records maybe were all good i dont know i did 
hear any them just number he has numbers he has 
contributions game community he great role model i would
 say he best pitcher ever pitch game probably even
top he would first pitcher i would put hall fame
because his accomplishments nohitters strikeouts respectable numbers 
even some weaker teams you can go i really hope he gets all
 possible votes

so summing up i have groups those belong those probably do
 i am sure those i lean towards saying dont belong least
 without my seeing stats possibly hearing reasons why should go

yes winfield yount brettnot your mail o smith puckett ryan
maybe murray l smith
 reardon garvey morris evans definately kingman

 i said i do have stats around so i do have numbers back 
up entirely my opinions based my perceptions
