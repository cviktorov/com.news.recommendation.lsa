 fascinating you say alomar better hitter last 
year immediately follow up numbers showing baerga
had better year only category i see which shows advantage
 alomar obp

 hmmmwhat about walks sb baerga got clobbered alomar obp 
beat him slg lesser margin even putting aside any other factors
 player point edge obp more productive than player 
 point edge slg issue has been studied before i doubt you
could come up any convincing argument other way
 people see batting average hr dont really know 
 value worth unless theyve studied issue closely fact 
baerga ate up lot more outs than alomar while baerga making outs
alomar drawing walks being base carter winfield etal
