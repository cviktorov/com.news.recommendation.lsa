yeah phillies played over heads almost whole year
 all caught up them one game streak i am old 
 man i big phillies fan time age 
september still painful thing remember i can tell you
 phillies never led league year going memory
alone i believe biggest lead games were
 ahead when famous game losing streak began streak
during which seemed found just about every way lose
known man anyway i think rebounded just before end 
won last couple games were still thing until 
final day finished tied giants one game out didnt
 dodgers somebody else finish two games back has 
one closest last minute scrambles ever

ok you guys stirred up my childhood memories so i went did
some research final month so season turns

far phillies record goes september

now doesnt appear me phillies pitchers bunning short
were really overused least fourman rotation standard 
 day until well along game losing streak which
time mauch probably desperate win any cost because 
phillies substantial lead had evaporated way were used 
 time may have made problem worse although bunning had one
 his sharpest games year final day shutout 
 reds cost reds share pennant bunning pitched
 complete game sixhitter striking out five walking one 
would inetersting see though how total innings 
year bunning short stacks up against rest league
also notice phillies played every day from least september 
through october while didnt play substantially more games than
 other teams other teams each had couple days off during 
stretch
