joe torre has worst manager baseball

 anyone who didnt see sundays game

 right hander pitching he decides bench lankform left handed
hitter play jordan gilkey both right handers

later ninth inning bases loaded two outs he puts
lankford hitter power pinch runner uses luis
alicea hitter power pinch hitter what hell
 he thinking

 your information lankford injured i think his shoulder rib
cage so he could use him pinch hitter
 
earlier game interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented
how fortunate cardinals were get whiten whiten would 
regular even though meant gilkey would hurt torre said
he liked gilkey coming off bench gilkey hit over last year
what does he have do start guy would starting most every
team league

i do believe whiten very good aquisition cards he does
 have too much offensive capabilities he awesome defensively
since when have cardnials actually thought offense instead defense
i forgot who st louis gave up him too much
 
 far gilkey concerned he leftfielder so brian jordan who
beat him out i expect see gilkeyjordan platoon lf
 
furthermore sundays game when lankford thrown out plate
 replay showed bucky dent third base coach looking down line
 waving lankford home

i agree you one soon larkin threw ball i knew 
lankford dead bird how could dent have known larkin would make
 perfect throw
 
i strongly believe torre one best managers baseball dont
forget overachieving cards won all those close games went
from last place second place although were oveshadowed braves
twins last first climb he won division title barely lost pennant
race when he braves why atlanta ever even considered firing him i
 never understand torre controls cardinals heading
 right direction
 
one more thing one game does make season yes lost reds
 second best pitching staff national league first 
east pretty good offense redbirds win lot more than 
lose maybe year go all way
 
charles very enthusiastic cardnials fan
