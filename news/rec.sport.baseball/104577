 going over some videos last night


 you wrote excellent report about 


 hes bulked up too much period he needs lose about pounds
 gain more bulk

 his bat speed has absolutely vanished conservatively id say hes
 lost his bat speed thats huge amount speed

 open stance killing him note he acts sort like
 brian downing way open start closes up ball 
 released downing could do without significant head movement 
 canseco cant also note canseco doesnt always close his
 stance same way sometimes his hips open sometimes
 theyre fully closed without good starting point its hard
 make adjustments your swing


i understand from unreliable source canseco considered
expendable when he refused accept any coaching about
his batting stance brain trust came believe his
back problems were exacerbated caused having wide open
stance closing quickly swinging lot torque
thats paraphrase what i remember

 any event canseco took road he he alone would decide
his stance began believe he would either reinjure
himself begin lose his ability hit both average power



aside from salting away large sum cash i could never touch
so id never have work again id restructure my entire swing

apparently you sound like larussa

second drop pounds cut out weight work

 also objected about 


 cansecos open stance resulting bad habits result his back
problems hell out baseball three years he could
still hit hr

again im just repeating something i heard possibly cause
 effect reverse
