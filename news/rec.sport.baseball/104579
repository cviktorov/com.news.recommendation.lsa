just little something i found while reading village voice which
 noted its sports coverage occasionally print some
interesting features year predictionsteam analyses 
 season were presented form bob dylan lyrics i
dont have article front me so ill only give memorable
ones here i remember know melody i could dig up more
 interest

yankess tune subterranean homesick blues

howe basement mixing up medicine
george pavement thinking bout government
wade boggs trench coat bat out paid off
says hes got bad back wants get laid off
look out kids its somethin you did
dont know when its columbus again

mets tune like rolling stone

once upon time you played so fine
you threw away dykstra before his prime didnt you
people said beware cone hes bound roam
 you thought were just kidding you
you used laugh about 
 strawberry headin out
 now you dont talk so loud
now you dont seem so proud
about having shop vince coleman your next deal

phillies tune highway 

well daulton dykstra should have some fun
just keep them off highway 

giants tune ballad rubin hurricane carter

 story magowan
 man st petersburg came pan
 something he never done
hes sit owners box one
day he could have tampian world
