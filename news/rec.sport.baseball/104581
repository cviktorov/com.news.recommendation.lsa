id willing make two wagers
 snow doesnt win roy
 mattingly out baseball within five years

im skeptical first because i dont think snow good 
player he losing team


i dont have history handy i dont recall preponderance
 roys come from winning teams fact i think team performance 
generally irrelevant almost always most deserving candidate wins
am i wrong

 he necessarily losing team while angels staff
 still very weak everyday lineup doing quite well thank
you snow playing great salmon learning make adjustments
easley appears fine even hes flora ready come up
between gonzales gruber theyll manage hot corner polonia
 curtis steady heady even myers orton contributing

personally i think can finish over which makes them 
winning team




 beastmaster 



im skeptical second because his back mattingly 
year how many players play until too many 
most them didnt have chronic back problems when were 

could wrong either both i think thats smart way 
bet

cheers
