im still catching up from spring break bear me

 bigs especially when havent even played aaa ball we
certainly believe kid going very good some day 
 really need rush him especially since we have mega
million dollar staff probably well served batterymate
who expereienced game calling pitcher handling lopez
time come lets give him some time aaa


javy lopez has proven over ab minor leagues he 
ready play majors he being rushed players who 
clearly too good aa play behind stiffs major league level
 wasting time may actually have court case against
major league management keeping them aaa

 maybe i need improve my writing skills lopez who very
ordinary defensively likely hit so well age 


unless lopez me defensively im born play
second base he belongs major leagues

training what does he have do earn chance maybe full
time job least couple starts few ab him prove
his worth

gee i dont know abs sounds pretty good me about good
 your reasoning kid should play backup role rather
than start every day aaa talk about me gm

valentine isnt saying he should back up hes saying he should put
 position win job major leagues which imho he
would given opportunity val im misinterpreting please
let me know

so far you have come up two arguments against lopez
 he very ordinary defensively
 he young most players suck when young

 first irrelevant hes trying make majors his bat
 second involves seriously warped reasoning

valentine

ok most players ready bigs age see current
related posting clayton one my favorites most players 
benefit rather than being stagnant hurt playing aaa
most catchers need solid defensively players help 
clubs bigs those arguments against lopez 
braves year

 players who ready best ones most
likely benefit from being majors javy lopez middle
oftheroad prospect hes real thing now 

again most important thing player can do hit lopez does 
miles better than olson berryhill his defense good enough 
greenville richmond its good enough atlanta he really 
awful defensively he would longer catcher see sprague ed

now braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities call games work pitchers throw out
runners superstars mind you solid experienced veterans
 braves have very solid lineup two big bats 
outfield excellent platoon first solid mvp candidate
 third one better hitting shortstops center
field platoon probably hit however good lopez
what have offset differential experience 
defensive ability kid improve playing aaa 
he probably wont being reserve big club 

oh where start ok first all solid good i want good players
solid one those words used describe nice white guys who really
arent very good baseball think twg without caps
its losing strategy say we have solid guys we dont need improve
you used four times paragraph btw

same experienced i might add though greg olson damon
berryhill arent exactly carter fisk olson has played three years
berryhill five although were wash only difference
imho between olson valle supporting cast

two big bats hrm i like justice i find mr gants trend disturbing
call one maybe braves platoon ok neither player
has any value outside platoon bream vs lh hunter vs rh
 awful ill leave thirdbase comment alone pendleton has wasted
too much bandwidth already cf platoon hits ill retrace
mr likhanis midnight run down forbes i live ny la
got mike

 doesnt cox call pitches anyway

goodness do you believe other poster who thinks lopez
 being held down because his future earning potential
why earth do you people thinkthe braves made decision
 idiots who have built ballclub jeeeesh

nope theyre baseball management possible most shortsighted 
collection people nation do you believe goes 
mark do you think frank thomas needed those three months aaa 
 cal eldred wasnt really better than ricky bones last year

 im treasure

youre mostly polite make defensible flawed cases have wit 
have past admitted being wrong does qualify you rsb
well make sdcn out you yet
