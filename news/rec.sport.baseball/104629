however what policy trying speed up games

i agree nick whats big deal about long games you want
 watch baseball theres much more baseball watch yes
baseball includes space between plays well plays themselves

i hesitate make assumptions about other people when write 
neither you two sound though you have kids you may have
spouses either

consider night game starting pm est last year
 cleveland showed what i thought good sense pushing back
i go im until pm minimum extra innings could put me
well past midnight even without extra innings score beyond
 i cant see my family night all next day workday
i may have bag well further later game goes 
colder gets shore lake erie

all stuff enters my consideration even going game 
you say you dont care about whether game sped up impo you 
saying you dont care where time goes game people
who dont have families dont have get up work next day

i can play me better than anyone theres only one me
