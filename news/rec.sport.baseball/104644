 reasonable umpire would do hes been instructed do season get
 batters back box sooner try cut down ridiculous
length games i one am glad see happen hope more
umpires do hirschbeck did instructing pitcher pitch 
 batter wont get back box 


 reasonable umpire would have recognized ron gant 
disturbed call reasonable umpire would have realized 
 run game progress two outs ninth what
ron gant did try regain his composure what normal baseball
player would have done would have been get heated argument
 umpire since you cant argue balls strikes he would
have been ejected from game ron gant trying avoid 
conflict penalized showing some restraint

incidentally reasonable home plate umpire would have been
so resistant seeking appeal first base umpire gant
requested home plate umpire had appealed first first base
umpire could have wrung up strike gant would have been so
upset call had been ball catcher had requested 
appeal likely home plate umpire would have asked help

finally entire game pretty much mockery socalled
efforts speed up game game played very quickly 
just hours when stuff happened ninth only delays
 entire game had been result actions umpires other than
deion having clean garbage off field
