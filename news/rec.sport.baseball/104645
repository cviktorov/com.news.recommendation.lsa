we cannot isolate completely roger we can make pretty good
estimate i wont claim split hairs say we can really
measure who better robby alomar carlos baerga last year 
difference too close call larkin lee clemens 
morris differences too great 

 your measure game why should team has just won 
all ever replace single player since now clearly best
how can do better yet every team can always find someplace where
 beleive can improve team can always find player
 little better than one already have btw my definitions
 best player one who does most things help his team
win i allow could vary depending who else 
team having aptitudes one team needs more than others

well given your definition best conceivable 
alfredo griffin could bring something team team needs
 win while larkin might have something team needs
would griffin better than larkin
 

baseball team game made individual talents 
absurd judge success failure individual success
 failure his teammates whom he did choose least most
cases morris won last year because he played team joe
carter robby alomar tom henke juan guzman john olerud et al
clemens lost because he surrounded lesser performers 
herm winninham luis rivera jeff reardon define quality
 team sum its components i do albeit imperfectly
 lesser error than defining quality individual 
mean quality team my reading your arguments suggests you
do

 i am trying define quality individual least 
 purpose ranking them toronto won olerud might
have won fielder might have won thomas detroit
might have won thomas chicago might have won fielder you
cant rank individuals you can only look who might contribute
more team effort which winning ws thomas could 
have contributed goal any more than olerud so i cannot say 
olerud less player
