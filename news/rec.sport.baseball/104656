 however what policy trying speed up 
 games you first person nonmediot i have seen endorse
 policy i have problem length games all 
 am tired espn crowd other announcers bitching about
 i have never been ballpark filled people looking
 watches shouting hurry up i cough up big bucks 
 ticket i dont mind game last more than i really dont
 understand 
 

major league baseball trying expand its appeal people shorter
attention spans ie football crowd invariably all 
arguments from people who dont like watch baseball tv say 
same thing games too long too boring baseball trying
 find way shorten games wider tv appeal you look 
 though baseball games last around same amount time football
games difference more action duration 
football games perhaps were more action baseball games you
would get more those fans tune anyway coming up solution
 make baseball more appealing bigger crowd going difficult
 soapbox yet another reason get commisioner now since its obvious
 ruling baseball comittee works about fast snail race 
nebraska off soapbox
