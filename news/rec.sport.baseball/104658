its certainly very easy what i do use frame advance tape
 simply count frames five times try throw out any outliers
its perfect its better than blow head large
metal object

 ah so you finally found use super slomo frame advance
other than scrutinizing sorority babes heat congrats 

i wish i had films instead tapes preferably fps rather than

garys list ten slowest bats baseball

 hey fair what about fettucine alfredo griffin guy practically
has pivot bat around along his body 

garys list how hell can he hit like 

 julio franco
 phil plantier
 darren daulton

 daulton doesnt strike me all strange hes little bit quiet 
 plate like franco gets bat through hitting zone level
plane first time i watched julio franco i didnt think anyone could
hit like now i marvel how easy he makes look every time he makes
contact its solid hes got good power all fields rarely he
caught ready pitch 

 i wonder phil plantier had severe bout hemorrhoids had 
practice his swing while throne sure looks like 

 how bout one add your list travis fryman guy plants his front
foot seems swing across his body he generates lot power 
i keep thinking he could generate even more he could get better pivot
out his hips 

garys list id give dave kirschs kidneys have swing like 

 well theyre already spoken several people 

 id add robbie alomars name list among others i really like dean
palmers swing some twisted reason well pedro munozs swing 

thats all now im looking derrick mays tapes tonight along
 troy neels guy serious ox

 thought about may looks like theyve taught him turn ball
imho hes going fall love his newfound power start pulling
off ball point hes going see lots sinkerssliders
low away unless he adjusts quickly starts rifling doubles left 
 leftcenter imho youre going see good number weak grounders 
 right side infield next month
