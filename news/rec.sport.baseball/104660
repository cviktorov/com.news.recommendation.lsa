i agree hirschbeck just doing what he instructed do
 also gant should have listened him however what 
policy trying speed up games you first person 
 nonmediot i have seen endorse policy 

i wholeheartedly endorse 

 i have problem 
length games all am tired espn crowd other announcers 
bitching about i have never been ballpark filled people looking
 watches shouting hurry up i cough up big bucks 
ticket i dont mind game last more than i really dont
understand 

havent been many games have you

seriously i dont mind baseball game lasts long time lasts
 long time because good baseball being played however i dont
like games take hours because theres lot dead time going
 game i dont find anything exciting about watching batter 
pitcher wander around between pitches watching catcher make slow
walk mound watching lots pitcher changes good reason
whitey herzog used master game could way out 
reach hed still making switches platoon advantage 

i want see game people standing around i dont really enjoy
watching nfl football games person example because theres so much
dead time you dont really notice how much dead time you watch
 television because theyre busy showing you replays i dont like
 college basketball games have so many time outs end game
 ncaa has made some moves try alleviate problem next
year theyre going stop clock after made baskets late games next
year theyre going second clock 

theres also difference how tolerant i am long games im
watching them tube im going person me going
 game has become major commitment time one im 
willing make often length games costing 
revenue from me
