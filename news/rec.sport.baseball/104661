 since time immemorial batters have complained about calls
so have pitchers catchers

however batters didnt use go strolls after bad calls degree
 do now 

unless league notified teams year about allowing
complaints hirschbeck acting against expectations

everyone told new emphasis speeding up games rule 
hirschbeck invoked has been books long time

 its gant hirschbecks face 

nobody including hirschbeck ever said he 


when gant turned away hirschbeck immediately motioned gant
 step box imo point time hirschbeck
 determined show gant exactly who charge game
gant wasnt dawdling he hadnt had chance dawdle hirschbeck
 simply exercising power play 

thats your perhaps colored your partisanship braves
perception hirschbecks view gant heading off long
walk accordance his instructions concerning speeding games up
directed him batters box

 gant resisted many 
us might what we thought unreasonable request 
hirschbeck called pitch

 point based rulebook umpires instructions 
 unreasonable request

 braves were already upset

imo any game where you remember name umpire 
 bad game umpire

had gant done instructed you wouldnt have remembered name 
umpire
