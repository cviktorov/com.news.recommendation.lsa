 hispanic magazineapril had couple interesting articles about
hispanic players including its hispanic allstar team 
some major points 

nprs morning edition aired report morning 
hispaniclatin american players mlb how have many 
 same problems faced blacknegroafrican american players
when first entered league however although baseball
has adjusted presence black players many hispanic
players still labor under stereotype being fireballs
hot blooded flashy report also emphasised despite
 rantings my word jessie jackson about baseballs
discrimination against black players its upper echelons
baseball has actually done much better black players than
hispanic players

another interesting point language barrier problem 
reporter elaborated interview ruben sierra which he
gave spanish spanish speaking newspaper reporter 
 fact maybe major baseball writers 
speak spanish despite fact spanish one 
 easiest languages learn so easy author cormac
mccarthy learned spanish age order research his
book all pretty horses yet few mlb organizations
employ spanish speaking personel one exceptions being
 oakland 

another point

nearly latin american players have some african blood
yet most report theyd never really felt black until
playing ball us

 
ironically enough early presence latin american
baseball players major leagues support idea 
baseball integrated before arrival jackie robinson
 many light black brown latin americans were
incorporated baseball
