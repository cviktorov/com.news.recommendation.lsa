hey valentine i dont see boston any world series rings 
fingers
yah so
damn morris now has three probably hall fame his 
future
he certainly didnt earn his last one how many games did he blow
 world series all ones he started
he certainly did earn he valuable member blue jay team 

 particularly world series during season he probably
more valuable than say putting olerud out pitch yeah he
 valuable getting them postseason he sucked dirty
canal water through straw jays won spite morris much more
than because him

therefore i would have say toronto easily made best signing
oh yes definitely therefore morris better than clemens
your definition better refers some measurement scale 
has nothing do winning ws rings

umm roger return us those halcyon days few postings ago
where poster valentine replying used ws rings measure
 better concept called context you should really become
familiar someday

 facts morris
has shown us he has what takes play ws winning club
clemens hasnt

unless transaltes clemens hasnt gone lou gormans office 
 large caliber handgun refused come out until hed been traded 
 jays im complete loss any possible meaning 

you can go about what clemens has done 
past claim he better than morris you want 
 facts morris has shown us he can win clemens
hasnt

what earth does mean over careers clemens has won 
 games hes started morris per year clemens has averaged nearly 
wins morris just under would you grant proposition preventing
 other team from scoring increases your chances winning game 
so consider clemens allows runs innings pitched morris
allows nearly run more per nine innings fact jack morris has never 
his career had era single year good clemens career era 
i forget maynardverse obviously some mystical significance
 buckner missing grounder had morris been sox 
would have been routine groundout right

whether clemens better your standard measurement
 totally meaningless object game compile 
high figures statistics you have chosen feel important
 object game contribute ws victories 
has been patiently explained you many many times you 
either too stupid too stubborn grasp 

speaking stupid has been patiently notsopatiently explained 
you many times attributing greatness players based 
accomplishments teams makes about much sense claiming 
 racecar has most attractive paint job because won race your
continued failure only understand even intelligently reply 
any arguments presented leads me conclusion you must have
spent few too many games goal without mask

dont give me shit boston had alomar olerud henke 
ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would
have looked little different last fall give credit where credit 
due lavishing praise morris makes me sick
yes dog would have caught rabbit tooforget about what
didnt happen open your eyes once look out 
see what really happening forget about how morris shouldnt
have won era over 
when morris pitched last year jays won stop crying about 
get life

 one crying jays won team certainly deserved win
 least al east performed well two short series won 
world series i congratulate them red sox fan i hope 
keep morris i happy when picked up stewart elated when 
traded darrin jackson you see unless you believe some mystical link
between morris offense you can hardly help believe man
 credited so many wins last year because he got lucky luck runs
out just like did when he pitched odd more innings than 
gave up exactly one earned run more than went 

seriously roger id really like hear your explanation difference
between morris morris which one better pitcher
 why did morris somehow learn how win intervening ten years
 so why did he go minnesota era over half
 run lower than
