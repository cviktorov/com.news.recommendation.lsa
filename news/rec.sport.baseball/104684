yes everyone seems agreement yankees 
finally moving right direction should finish
over year maybe even pennent race 
 august however i would take back few moves

 jim abbott trade
 i think abbott only inspirational person 
 great pitcher also he could win cy young year 
 he wont because right side yanks infield
 isnt good enough so why good trade 
 jt snow how many rookies have been able step 
 immediately have impact he has had so far 
 angels i know its early youve seen kid
 hit field talk you can just tell he going 
 tremendous player yanks should have kept him what
 about mattingly you ask well its great yanks
 have taken care him remained loyal hes years
 older than snow just doesnt have same bat speed 
 before his back injury its shame yankee fan 
 who wants see best yankee team id take 
 snow over mattingly first yanks also gave up two
 promising propects snow abbott besides 
 domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello sterling
 hitchcock just loaded propects i know abbotts
 only too much give up i believe george
 forced trade because he believes hes right 
 abbott big hit ny however id like see 
 yankees build baseball team amusement show

 wade boggs
 i live boston like wade lot his career 
 winding down i would rather see yanks start develop
 long term solution ie hensley muelins russ davis velarde
 besides wade just doesnt have any range what shame about
 charlie hayes huh

 spike owen
 see wade boggs id much rather see them develop dave silvestri
 whoever wade spike next each other infield 
 going raise yankee staff era point guys
 down sides careers

 danny tartabull
 yes hes put up some tremendous numbers its nice think
 about what he could do he were ever healthy all year he
 never we should expect games max out him meanwhile
 gerald williams playing columbus paul oneil playing
 left field i believe oneil led nl outfielders assists
 last year tartabull poor defensive outfielder

what im basically getting yanks moving right
direction ready win pennent year should
 gm level planning world series 
means getting younger players experience majors now so 
 ready year two 

im afraid all stuff wreaks george steinbrenner
certainly boggs deal all george looks like george 
planning right mix veterans young players win world
series now veterans always available can added any
time like boston did year develop young players first
 add one two veterans yankees case just keep
them lets all us yankee fans hope george doesnt dismantle
 terrific job stick company have done building yankee
organization back one respect im really afraid he 
trade whoever takes patch holes today relief pitching 
example george must realize yankees rebuilding process 
still one two years away have patience george we all
enjoy future fire bucky trade kids its baseball
hell all loyal yankee fans long time
