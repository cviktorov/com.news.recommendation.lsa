i have posted two new postings net since i discovered how use 
 both times i received redicule predicting red sox high 
third al east id like hear why people dont think sox
can high third year here some my observations

well had you been bit less exuberant both tone substance 
your predictions responses would probably have been bit more
measured may

 roger frank vintage form sox rresponding them
clemens always form viola isnt really performing beyond
what might reasonably have been expected how do you know sox 
responding them al bumbry hobson my most likely
suspect new hitting coach mike easler i certainly am more likely give
easler credit mo vaughhns hot start than clemens viola

 greenwell hitting he did before his injuries
 optimistic scenario unreasonably so he hasnt shown
much power yet though

 dawson providing leadership some hitting need from him
how can you tell dawson providing leadership perhaps its
calderon perhaps its clemens viola maybe hobson finally showing
those people skills he supposed have when hired him maybe
its all myth dawson has been hitting reasonably well 
well greenwell vaughn cooper fletcher

 russell finishing well
 three games why dont we look one again say july

 fletcher hitting well leadoff hitter
 bit better than could reasonably have been expected dont forget 
zupcic looked like wade boggs lite about abs last year beware 
small sample sizes still fletcher hits well he did last year hed
 great improvement over any sox leadoff hitter from last year aware
 his career numbers seem indicate he puts up good numbers 
long he doesnt have make more than ab so year

 cooper hitting well i think hell better boggs field
 just good plate
ummmsorry i can buy field part i think hell 
better plate than boggs general cooper while hell
 pretty good hitter couldnt carry boggs jockstrap little
luck he could fourth fifth best b al martinez boggs
ventura palmer all better

 sox pitch like last year have better pitchiong staff now
 hit like so far coiuld run away thee division 
since i think hitting pitching may up challenge
 running away division i think win over 
least third second first

see here where you make quick left turn off aether 
 plausible third unlikely phrases like could run away 
 division likely get you visit from men white
coats its really clear staff better than last year 
russell does well darwin doesnt go dl hesketh doesnt pitch
just barely well enough avoid losing his spot rotation could
 better other hand hesketh pitches miserably theyre too
stupid move him pen bring up conroy somebody fossas
continues pitch dismally keep giving him innings becasue hes 
lefty russell explodes could pretty bad
