stuff about ron gant incident deleted 
 reasonable umpire would do hes been instructed do season get
 batters back box sooner try cut down ridiculous
 length games i one am glad see happen 

i agree hirschbeck just doing what he instructed do
 also gant should have listened him however what 
policy trying speed up games you first person 
 nonmediot i have seen endorse policy i have problem 
length games all am tired espn crowd other announcers 
bitching about i have never been ballpark filled people looking
 watches shouting hurry up i cough up big bucks 
ticket i dont mind game last more than i really dont
understand 

games longer now several reasons more pitching changes
more basestealing throws first etci think very small factor
 increased time takes jose canseco deion sanders insert fancy
showboat ballplayer here arrange jewelry prior stepping 
batters box my impression sportcasters writers have made 
 issue because like shorter games get head back hotel
bar eat steaks get drunk tell stupid jokes pals chase
stewardesses around bar sure want game over print 
journalists have slightly more legitimate reason wanting faster games
 have deadlines espn guys baseball tonight drive me crazy 
constantly harp primarily because often have work late 
when game goes longer than 

maybe i am just neerdowell nothing better do i 
would like hear reasons why longer games upset you

 parenthetical note seems league any case fighting
 losing battle year increased offense thus far certainly 
spoil any hopes getting games over more quickly
