however what policy trying speed up games
you first person nonmediot i have seen endorse policy
i have problem length games all am tired 
espn crowd other announcers bitching about i have never
been ballpark filled people looking watches 
shouting hurry up i cough up big bucks ticket i dont mind
 game last more than i really dont understand 

i agree nick whats big deal about long games you want
 watch baseball theres much more baseball watch yes
baseball includes space between plays well plays themselves

first longer game way suggests more baseball watch unless
you include watching grass grow baseball lengthier games
 so because batters stepping out box pitchers taking
longer between pitches excessive trips mound managers
 pitching coaches

 while its true gaps between plays can interesting 
 only true when dont become extralong quicklypitched games
can grab hold your attention much better

bring back twohour baseball game three half hour
golf game
