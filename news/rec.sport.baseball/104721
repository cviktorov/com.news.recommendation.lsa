baseball team game made individual talents 
absurd judge success failure individual success
 failure his teammates whom he did choose least most

carter robby alomar tom henke juan guzman john olerud et al
clemens lost because he surrounded lesser performers 
herm winninham luis rivera jeff reardon define quality
 team sum its components i do albeit imperfectly
 lesser error than defining quality individual 
mean quality team my reading your arguments suggests you
do
 
 i am trying define quality individual least 
 purpose ranking them toronto won olerud might
 have won fielder might have won thomas detroit
 might have won thomas chicago might have won fielder you
 cant rank individuals you can only look who might contribute
 more team effort which winning ws thomas could 
 have contributed goal any more than olerud so i cannot say 
 olerud less player

 you going pick guys who have won most ws rings guys who 
could contribute most your team say reds were dumb enough
