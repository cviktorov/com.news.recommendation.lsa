team you dont have team moment draft coming up who
 you going pick guys who have won most ws rings guys who 
could contribute most your team say reds were dumb enough 
 protect larkin jays didnt protect alfredo who would you
pick

 expansion team im pretty sure i would go rings long
 salaries ages werent too high i would want fans 
able identify players i would like championship attitude 
clubhouse

 larkin griffin salaries aside i would have consider which
player likeliest contribute ws victory past performance age 
attitude would all integral my decision i certainly wouldnt just
haul out my copy gillete pick larkin many others would 
unlike many others who post group i hardly consider myself quali
fied make those kinds decisions
