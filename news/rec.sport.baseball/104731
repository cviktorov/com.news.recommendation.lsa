 hed been thrown out gant had legitimate beef about
 pitch called strike reasonable umpire would
 have tried force gant back box situation

 reasonable umpire would do hes been instructed do season get
 batters back box sooner try cut down ridiculous
length games i one am glad see happen hope more
umpires do hirschbeck did instructing pitcher pitch 
 batter wont get back box 

while i can see why want cut down time spent walking around
gant wasnt ordered back box sooner he ordered back immediately
 soon he stepped out hirschbeck told him get back box
now gant doesnt take lot walks between pitches only reason
he did because he very bothered call i expect his
concentration wasnt yet crucial situation i imagine its
best calm possible contributing factors would gants
bad day plate bad year plate braves long scoring
drought

now its pretty stupid go ahead talk walk when umpire 
telling you get you know umpire going do something
call strike throw you out etc gant wrong

 hirschbeck more wrong my biased view aside from major chip
he seemed have his shoulder what problem gant had reason
 want some time disputed strike call gant hadnt been wasting time all
game game had been cruising along just over two hours old
 score outs ninth runner scoring position
 any reason hirschbeck couldnt shouldnt cut gant little
slack discernible constructive reason hirschbeck disrupted 
game caused five minute delay materially hurt batter key
situation did he have date get 

 i still wonder why terry tossed earlier game
