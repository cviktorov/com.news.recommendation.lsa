 finally id like point out many high obp guys draw 
 walks more because pitchers afraid throw strike
 them than because have great eye

 comes up periodically i just dont get take example mark
mcgwire he walked times thats potential great example
 what youre talking about i dont know what now lets look 
what happens when mcgwire doesnt walk
 time he made out
 time he hit single
 time he hit double
 time he hit homer
now youre pitching against mcgwire would you trade walks homers
 double singles outs i would why give him base when you
can get him out times out 

i didnt say pitchers fear throwing strikes guys like
mcgwire bonds frank thomas rational 
i just said exists

 guys like alex cole who has career obp even
though hes never had batting average over he did hit 
 ab hit single home run yep thats right hes
never hit homer abs through end whod 
afraid throw strike him

i dont know alex coles batting style all some questions
how tall he
does he go crouch like rickey hedersonpete rose
does he foul off lot pitches like brett butler
does he take strikes each bat

 could cole has good batting eye
look above i said many high obp guys draw walks because
pitchers afraid throw strike them all high obp guys
