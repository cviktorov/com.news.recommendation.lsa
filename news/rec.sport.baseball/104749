 you want speed up ballgames
 
 mandate rule permitting only n seconds between pitches current
 
 rule too lenient enforce fifteen seconds more
 
please pardon my ignorance well known what current 
rule 

 than enough time pitch isnt released call ball
 restart clock
 
i remember post from last year indicating pitch clock tried
 one minor leagues some time back did work i dont remember
why said did work anyone remember 

jody mcdonnel wip phil has been saying pitch clock 
inevitable how would pitch clock work throws first

maybe we could limit number throws first pitcher can make
 award balk he exceeds id have another question who would 
operate pitch clock one umpires add another one crew

another pair suggestions
 remove balk rule runners responsibility stay safe
 matter what pitcher does

im sure i like idea i think would severely diminish 
number stolen bases limit availability neat strategic
ploys hit run squeeze play one my personal favorites

 pitcher throws occupied base more than x time x 
 without successfully picking off runner runner advances base
 walked

ahhh i suppose i should read whole article before i hit f key
eh obviously from what i wrote above i like idea

 nobalk seems give pitcher advantage basewalk allows
 runner challenge pitcher throw over base

 may also increase number wild throws bag since 
pitcher knows he doesnt have very many chances pick off runner
so he may hurry too much id rather see runs scored result 
sound hitting sound baseball strategy rather than sloppiness
 could result from kind rule so i suppose some
disadvantages idea too

 baseball games take about nl just shade under hours
 al thats just too damn long i dont like play hour
 games much less watch game long my butt falls asleep 
 im watching tv ill channel surf between pitches catching
 colorized versions mr ed leave beaver those wacky
 nieporents nick nite

i too find myself surfing when i know enough time between
each pitch allow batter adjust his jewlery

i remember little league when up bat we stepped out batters
box even moment we were automatically out may little 
harsh majors seriously how about putting limit 
batters being able step out take several dozen practice swings pound
 shoes scratch balls etc maybe forcing them stay 
batters box wouldnt bad idea could save few minutes
