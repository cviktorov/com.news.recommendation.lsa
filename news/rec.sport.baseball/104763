when gant turned away hirschbeck immediately motioned gant
 step box imo point time hirschbeck
 determined show gant exactly who charge game
gant wasnt dawdling he hadnt had chance dawdle hirschbeck
 simply exercising power play gant resisted many 
us might what we thought unreasonable request 
hirschbeck called pitch point cox came out 
 field pitch thrown many other braves left 
dugout cox tossed protecting his player i pleasantly
surprised gant kept his cool enough stay game

did you see same game i saw gant most reasonable argued 
horrible call which hirschbeck correctly did nothing about gant
 proceeded walk halfway rd base lean his bat 
glare hirschbeck while i dont necessasarily subscribe 
theory showing people up obvious attempt gant 
do so hirschbeck he left hirschbeck choice take control
 situation bottom line gant started dangerous
power struggle hirschbeck when his team needed him most 
he lost

 events i saw were
 called strike hirschbeck
 shockedlooking gant asks appeal first
 appeal first
 gant steps out batters box
 hirschbeck immediately orders gant back bad move
 gant ignores hirschbeck walks off bad move
 hirschbeck yells gant gant silent
 hirschbeck calls pitch
 pitch called strike
 cox argues couldnt see when he came field
 cox ejected players everywhere
 play finally resumes

gant shouldnt have ignored hirschbeck returning made strike
call fairly likely although i suspect argument might have gotten
gant tossed altogether hirschbeck had let gant step out 
whole incident probably would have been avoided
