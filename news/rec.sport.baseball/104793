just few lines about my favorite team sweeping dodgers one 
my least favorite la sweet also mets my other least 
favorite team loss rockies made great day 
great start weekend cardinals espn tonight

big lee smith having great start cardinals seem 
hitting clutch even though have had few games lots
 hits many runs hopefully coaches stress 
situational hitting spring training runners lob lower
 year probably due high strikeout numbers jose 
lankford zeiles off year

i dont know why all fuss about fillies media all 
filly fans rsb forget who right behind them standings 
give wild thing week two before he starts blowing some games 
 well see who first i believe cardinal pitching 
staff more complete than filly staff make 
difference

 side note few years ago comment made some 
baseball player manager about dodger defense he asked 
where hit ball against dodgers he replied fair i 
remember being said section sports illustrated
i would like know who said what issue 

go redbirds
