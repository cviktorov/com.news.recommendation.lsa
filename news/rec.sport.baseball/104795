guess which line which
baobpslgabhbbhrbb
x
y

 walks should give away obps general somewhat more valuable than
slugging alomars edge obp quite bit larger than baergas edge
 slugging

im sdcn whats more valuable

 hits w more doubles more hrs 
 more triples bbs lets forget extra sbs how many cs

alomar had cs baerga had 

dont forget more outs baerga had his gidp balances out his cs 
he had one more sacrifice than alomar replacement level second baseman
could have had hits walks couple xbh additional
outs baerga had triple little different than home run were talking
exchanging almost walks six seven home runs four doubles i 
would say almost walks more valuable

also alomar got far greater boost from his home park than baerga did from 
his six seven home runs hmm

so you wanted pick second baseman play toronto youd take 
alomar anywhere else youd probably take baerga
