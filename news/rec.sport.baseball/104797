most points you made about lopez v berryhillolson have been
made others realizing lopez must second coming 
frank thomas i have relented praised unmistakeable wisdom 
his supporters


nope theyre baseball management possible most shortsighted 
collection people nation do you believe goes 
mark do you think frank thomas needed those three months aaa 


see essentially what everyone doing comparing lopez
 one best players game im really looking forward
 seeing cantmiss superstar now thomas i remember
being advocate his being brought up even though he 
only cant remember who did sox have first
calderon martinez kittle spot talent 
 sure i say go 

i am convinced lopez anywhere near talented thomas
 after his aa season i am convinced olson
berryhill nearly bad kittlemartinez were

btw i dont think thomas hurt those three months





 cal eldred wasnt really better than ricky bones last year

well we cant compare our guy one best game
lets compare our decision one most boneshead right

cal eldred when he came up full season aaa 
longer minor league career frankly i dont know why he didnt
make club bones year younger lousy prior
history just watching him makes me think i missed 
career bigleague pitcher one i repeat one 
laughed louder than i did sheffield trade though i guess
mieske has future

i take back mcilvaine may have laughed louder

have past admitted being wrong does qualify you rsb
well make sdcn out you yet
