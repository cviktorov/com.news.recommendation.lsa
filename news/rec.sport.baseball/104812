absolutely sense least local gannett rag finds its way

official score card copy give several diffent people 
one those person from ap whose job type up using 
template laptop transmit ap offices new york
rockefeller center via telephone box scores checked
 just rebroadcasted over aps news delivery services 
corrections those issued later person sitting front
 laptop shea whereever whose fault note ap
puts out boxscores three different formats one you see 
most newspapers being first one

checking done stats sends ap im sure where
 appreveiations come hear i dont think statss may
just space correction ap sports editor day
