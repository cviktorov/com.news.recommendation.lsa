dj popular player san diego derek bell faring well 
clubhouse toronto so matter how bad he looks now i still think 
 steal jays just from perspective team chemistry

 i laugh you now i laugh you again equally publicly
when jays finish third due severe depletion talent

 jays finish third because depletion pitching staff
 because derek bell traded darrin jakson

i couldnt agree more jays have lot power lineup 
so far pitching has been biggest problem maybe we can get acker back 

 anyway point my post you missed derek bell 
traded because he basically doghouse cito rest 
 team

one incident sticks out my mind when derek bell ran back out 
 feild after jays had won division all players were
back clubhouse bell ran around field his arms air
waving big towel over his head he looked like big jerk especially
when you consider he did contribute much team over whole
season next day winfield carter somehow got keys bells
jeep brought out feild before game started stadium
announcer said going draw later game bells
jeep bell really freaked out i dont think bell popular after 

i think jackson might trying little too hard right now hes known
 being great outfielder hes only blue jay who has been
booting balls playing generally awful
