 well officially its braves least up until started winning
 still officially 
 so why how did receive label
 
 unoffically without doubt americas team cubs why
 well my guess because america loves underdogs every year matter
 cubs talent predictions never close never 
 possible win anything over years losing has mounted america
 has fallen love perennial losers cubs have more fans
 chicago some teams do worldwide cubs have more fans 
 worldwide than most teams division combined 
 aura excitement surrounds cubs beginning season
 like one else including ws champs must eternal hope
 year theyve got talent theyre off good start
 theyve got pitching hitting whatever strong point 
 time its inevitability cubs eventually 
 win ws again when only god knows since its been so long 
 could come any time could another years until 
 do finally win start winning consistently cubs remain
 americas lovable underdogs cubs areamericas team

you absolutely correct braves fans nothing bunch 
bandwagoners correct me i am wrong years ago you couldnt give
away ticket see braves playi would bet my next paycheck 
 socalled braves fans living outside georgia present time can 
name more than players from season other hand ask any
cubs fan living anywhere united states name players from any given
year them probably could
granted fact team wins brings people ball park 
 does mean diserve title americas team
 only reason considered americas team because ted
turner his little tv station which broadcasts across nation
ill consider toronto americas team before braves


go reds
