dale stephenson says

 events i saw were
 called strike hirschbeck
 shockedlooking gant asks appeal first
 appeal first
 gant steps out batters box
 hirschbeck immediately orders gant back bad move

even i noticed gants demeanor one batter
attempting regain his concentration gant stalking off
i wonder gant said something ump

 gant ignores hirschbeck walks off bad move

actually small hand wave gantas say
dont bother me gant may have said something here too

 hirschbeck yells gant gant silent
 hirschbeck calls pitch
 pitch called strike
 cox argues couldnt see when he came field

cox already halfway ump when strike called

 cox ejected players everywhere
 play finally resumes

gant shouldnt have ignored hirschbeck returning made strike
call fairly likely although i suspect argument might have gotten
gant tossed altogether hirschbeck had let gant step out 
whole incident probably would have been avoided

my impression gant stepping out he making
 protest about lack appeal first has been
pointed out earlier appeal first strike
i can understand gant feeling little pressure twoout
risp game ninth inning he let get him ump
also overreacted gant stalking off i doubt he would
have been gone long hirschbeck should have let him have 
moment compose himself before telling him come bat
imho umpires should more flexible than what hirschbeck
showed gant disturbed point pretty likely
he would get hit

 very bad finish pretty good game
