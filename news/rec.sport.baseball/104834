 before folks jump me let me ask net would jays
 have won al good pitcher from aaa place morris given
 his run support how about average ml pitcher i cant believe
 morris performance playoffs series had large positive
 impact jays performance 

i know its very trendy nowadays dump morris lets give credit
where credit due

 doubtful blue jays would have won al east without morris

well when you say without morris you have mention assumed
replacement alternative morris letting cito gaston
softtoss ball underhand opposition every days 
 course blue jays wouldnt have won without morris 
alternative replacement level i think wouldve been very
close yes morris mightve made difference alternative
 frank viola blue jays probably would have won more easily 
viola

last year when team went month august all 
other starters were being shelled milwaukee making charge
morris went pretty good era i cant remember exactly

yes you can make argument his presence prevented 
 team from collapsing august

also lets underestimate importance his innings save 
 bullpen every fifth day he didnt help us win al east forget
about pennent world series

those innings were probably helpful

his run support high runs so stottlemyers runs
 he won only games i do remember morris winning inordinate number 
 ballgames his credit he pitched only good
 he needed when he up ballgame he just put cruise
control threw ball up let batters get themseleves out
i hate expression inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying make perfect pitches keep his era down morris being 
veteran pitcher knows winning only thing really matters 
baseball saving himself he able reach back little extra
i hate too when game line

well i think complete bs what happened most time 
morris fell behind team came back rescued him mostly
 because hes lousy st inning pitcher much better
 rest way team can climb out holes
consistently win them morris credit its 
teams credit

furthermore while morris did exceed wl percentage would
 projected from his runs allowed run support he hasnt done
 previous years fact his wl record lot
worse than what projects run support runs allowed
do you think he just came up ability 

look postseason games he pitched decently typical
morris games morris gets behind team rescues him hes 
responsible rescue both those games team
just didnt rescue him enough jack morris pitched well he did
during much season those games offense just didnt
earn him victory

btw i think he should put bullpen would embarrassing 
veteran pitcher which cito would never do his era how much more
can he embarrassed

morris one those guys who reture when he cant start
anymore hes too bad first inning pitcher serve bullpen
