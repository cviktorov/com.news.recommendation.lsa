first longer game way suggests more baseball watch unless
you include watching grass grow baseball

i definitely do thats why i dont like going see games played
 artificial turf 

 lengthier games
 so because batters stepping out box pitchers taking
longer between pitches excessive trips mound managers
 pitching coaches

 while its true gaps between plays can interesting 
 only true when dont become extralong

well your idea interesting differs from mine i think
batting practice interesting example make special
effort get game very early order see i think 
delaying tactics batters pitchers catchers managers 
interesting because theyre attempts gain advantage through control
 flow timing game course umpires can 
should intervene when tactics get out hand ryan robbins
has pointed out rules cover 

one more fascinating things about baseball i think its
openendedness regard time you never know game going
 zip right over less than two hours its going 
go until four morning likewise some games actionpacked
 some games slow lazy thats fine me those folks who
want constant action should watch games tv so can channel
surf cater short attention spans
