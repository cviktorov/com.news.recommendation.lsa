 heading indicates impossible me fathom why barry 
batting th giants behind clark barry awesome 
consistent hitter definitely best national league imho 
have williams streaky hitter really clutch hitter batting
th ahead bonds simply injustice giants fans 
giants

 simple reasons

 batting williams ahead bonds create leftclark 
 rightwilliams leftbonds situation middle 
 batting order makes tougher opposing manager
 change pitchers

 having bonds batting behind williams means matt get
 more good pitches hit important since he struggles
 so much breaking balls opposing pitchers dont want 
 walk williams get bonds

both your reasons good ones joe morgan thinks bondsclark
williams should hitters while he believes clarkbonds
williams fine he definitely opinion bonds should hit
ahead williams i am inclined agree him
your first reason valid because bonds can hit both lefties righties
very well he hits lefties righties better than any other giant
williams still getting breaking balls although much last season
 bottom line bonds far more disciplined more productive
hitter than williams i prefer take my chances bonds driving 
 hitters who expected have high obps than williams
williams would get more fastballs bonds first second base open
because threat bonds stealing
