 hey valentine i dont see boston any world series rings 
 fingers damn morris now has three probably hall fame his 
 future therefore i would have say toronto easily made best 
 signing dont tell me boston win year wont 
 even top division more like th


 spite what all stat heads say jack morris played large role 
 jays winning world series last year i dont care his era 
he played leadership role did win games his era may have been high
 he did pitch many outstanding ball games

 he pitched many notsooutstanding ballgames too

jack essentially pitched lot ball last year certainly
isnt irrelevant iif you replace morris replacement level quality
 blue jays might win

re leadership i dont see leadership effect 
 starting pitcher you would expect see its primary effect 
pitching staff you would expect see rest staff improve
instead rest staff declined

you can make reasonable argument winfield providing leadership
 offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness previous
year im saying i buy least argument makes
internal sense
