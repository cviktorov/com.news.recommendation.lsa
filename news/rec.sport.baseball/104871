 end game each game determines which team best
 day end season team best 
most often best division playoffs determine 
best best point only decision making pro
cess used determine best score game re
lates teams individual players method
inherent baseball comparing individual performances 
 how should because after all baseball team game

 you know what method inherent real life
either so i would assume you would endorse notion we 
cannot state any level objectivity mother theresa
has accomplished more good world than joseph stalin
after all life earth team effort

 you want select group statistics claim clemens has
done better those statistics criteria fine you
have able prove those statistics measure 
individuals contribution winning ws because 
only measure best has any meaning context base
ball so until you can prove clemens contributes ws cham
pionship more than morris your evaluation clemens totally sub
jective mere opinion i have yet see any you can
predict ws winner any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon

have you tried glasses i find them quite useful 

after all must some reason you choose ignore mounds
 evidence we present its too bad you feel necessary close
your mind eyes knowledge you live poorer life result
 choice

heck id wager you could predict ws winner greater
accuracy than jeanne dixon you know why because i have
full confidence despite your protestations contrary
you quite capable using knowledge we can come up
 through statistical methods boost your knowledge level 

you dont have rude

have you tried calling kettle black

 you say means you have either missed entire point
 my argument you yourself have committed fallacy ignoratio
elenchi i am saying morris better than clemens because
he has more rings although i have tongue cheek claimed
 past i am saying impossible isolate 
individuals performance from his teams purpose 
comparing individuals performance another individuals per
formance

 other words your world you cannot objectively state 
jack morris more important blue jays than al leiter last
year

 your world may indeed true fortunately world
 rest us occupy its 

i hope you never serve jury roger i think rest 
jury would have kill you theres way i can objectively
judge defendant innocent guilty you see 
 billion other people planet we have way knowing
whether defendant would have committed crime wasnt
 all other people planet we have way knowing
how defendant would have acted had he been different planet
because living planet team effort individual
committs crime totally isolated from his society he part 
 society being case anything i have say his
culpability would absolute subjectivity so i refuse vote
