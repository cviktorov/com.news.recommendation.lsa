 course same claiming some do galarragas
inability defer gratification isnt hurting his team because he isnt
paid walk rbi guy whatever
alright thats enough ive suffered all kinds insults 
typical net give me break galarraga currently
batting over you guys complaining he isnt drawing
enough walks what would he have do please you guys bat 
you can hardly claim he hurting his team

 would help his obp were higher than his batting average yes 
april usa today lists le grand chapeau having batting average
 obp thats hitting zip nil nada walks
 reason lot us down galarraga hes has long history
 showing nowhere near his real level ability except 
drawing walks he hit say even abs id convinced 
 real change his ability he did obpavg id
 only amazed id make bet would unique feat 
 history game what do abs prove look some 
other fluke players point season
 player avg ab
 blauser 
 grace 
 milligan 
 conine 
 lansing 
 slaught 
 any guys really good well word how significant
 galarragas average ab level hit worth about 
hed had one those hits called error one taken away good
defensive play hed range he goes his next
game hes all way down one game come back june lets
talk 

 happens pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
 he starts making lots outs someone speculated might happen
 i would agree you he isnt taking enough pitches my comment
 he isnt paid walk doesnt mean he should have license
 swing bad pitches make outs its more along lines hes
batting leading league rbis so what bloody difference
does make he isnt drawing lot walks sheesh

its history greg andres history he doesnt walk much because he
swings bad pitches so his average isnt very good abs doesnt mean
 awful lot compared history couple thousand especially when
theres ample evidence bb his basic hitting approach hasnt
changed yeah he might suddenly have turned hitter who never
walks dont bet rent money
