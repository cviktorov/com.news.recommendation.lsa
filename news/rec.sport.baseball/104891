during spring training i made similarly innoncentlooking comment 
about clutch hitting bb flames were flying 
thing clutch hitting sdcns all screamed i assumed
 also meant thing any kind clutch performance
given comments im still licking wounds i do have
 rebuttal planned gotta do my homework say

some deletions
 rather showed quite convincingly 
past clutch performance has never been able predict future
clutch performance

im sure you convinced dave apparently so tony perez
i however am 


i believe time sabo plate appearance juan samuel
 bench available pinchhit duty over past four
seasons

nonclutchclutch 
abhbaabhba

sabo
samuel

i do claim complete statistical analysis 
proves existence clutch hitting compelling testimony 
samuel would have gotten base hit im sure something wrong
 sample size basic assumption clutch
performance random invalidates any conclusions from limited
application something other i dont pretend understand
statistical analysis


well we agree last part one basic things you need 
have statistic able predict players performance 
 future correlation from year year 
players batting average correlated fairly well from year year
 players ability walk infielders defensive average correlated
better say given past performance those statistics
we can have pretty good handle how theyll do next year put 
some simple information about aging you can do even better one 
 basic problems something like clutch batting average overall
batting average correlation from year year almost zero 
adding sample size doesnt seem help much counterexample 
what you showed consider following two players from 

 nonclutch clutch
 ab h ba ab h ba
 
maldonado 
lemon 

 you had had two players your logic those clutch
situations youd bat maldonado lemon blink eye well 
 maldonado hit nonclutch clutch while lemon
hit nonclutch clutch before you accuse me 
completely cooking data were players who had clutch
 bats every year from according elias simple
measure clutchness lets just look clutch banonclutch ba you use 
 predict those players youd find 
 were below league average measure both 
 were above league average both periods other were 
above one below other you were just flipping coins
youd expect get abovebelow both switched 
difference between observed results coin flip experiment
 statisically significant

btw correlating players overall batting average from 
 gives correlation coefficient which significant 
something better than confidence level correlating 
clutchnonclutch ba same period gives correlation 
 significant level any interest



 everyone would agree i hope grand 
slam bottom ninth when your team down three
 very clutch hit just way predict who more
likely get clutch hit based past performance hitting 
clutch situations


 you say so dave way 


actually its technically incorrect say we cant predict future
clutch performance its more correct say we cant predict
future clutch performance any skill
