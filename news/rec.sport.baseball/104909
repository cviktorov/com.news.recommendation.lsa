 didnt bob horner go straight from arizona state univ
 atlanta braves i remember he had one great
 month hitting dingers next i heard
 he japan

 month well he did have short careercompared what one might
 have expected highly touted prospectdue being injury prone
 overweight having work ethic he certainly did 
 suffer from being rushed bigs


sorry len exactly how he suffered from being rushed bigs
being overweight having work ethic leading being injury prone 
nothing loose might have been corrected richmond did you intend 
smiley after your comment


 i remember correctly which always doubt horners signing
 braves contingent starting atlanta i think
he could have gone back arizona st one more year he hadnt
signed anyhow braves did try send him richmond once
 lead weeklong walkout methinks horner had work ethic
before he drafted minor league play wouldnt have helped
 his raw talent would have gotten him ml did
keep him while until he started falling his wrists



eric too lazy update his sig roush
