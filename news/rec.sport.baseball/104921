obbase apparently new owner drayton mclain sp doesnt particularly
like excuses item our paper austin americanstatesman you
read here somewhere else first said he wouldnt take 
injuries excuse losing because possibility should have been
accounted uh oh i dont want owner thatll keep everybody 
edge id never gotten feeling about him who knows does 


 honest i think city houston loves new owner he has
brought baseball back houston key acquisitions players 
were from houston area wanted play astros i dont
think too many people fearful mclane meddle team
 he has already admitted he doesnt know whole lot about baseball
mclane businessman doesnt like excuses he makes valid point
 injuries shouldnt excuse club look depth 
bench season canadele can play positions bass james solid
outfielders can hit well too uribe nice have well 
pitching staff has legitimate starters were dealing young
houston team so injuries shouldnt play big role only threat 
 bullpen jonesy goes out we may trouble 
type starters we have season less pressure pen
