 ive recently been working project determine greatest
 players respective postions 

 b career 

what about u johnny hodapp greatest nd baseman cleveland indians
history hits consistantly over great great second baseman

um header said career hodapp managed about pa his
nine years majors

 his consistently over make three years row 
preceded parttime year plus his last year boston hodapp
only qualified batting title five times 

 he injured he retired right around his th birthday

anyway hodapp put up flashy numbers year everybody put up
flashy numbers his only really good year bat 
his other years were marred lack power inability
 draw walks only those pa were bases balls which
does describe feared hitter 

 other hand he part long line famous cleveland b
wambsganss riggs stephenson etc

roger

jon johnny hodapp
