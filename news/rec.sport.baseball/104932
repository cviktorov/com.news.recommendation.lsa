 hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves 
i

mean heck dave winfield hohum seriously being considered 


 lee smith ha why dont we give dave kingman chance darrell

evans yeah yeah after hall fame takes them can take 
eddie

murray jeff reardon

um what eddie murray superb first baseman long time

winfield produced consistently almsot years excellently
 several occasions 

dave kingmans best year like darryl strawberrys typical
year mets 

darrell evans too did whole lot more than just hit homers which 
 all kong did 

 well any case i am sick tired mostly sick everybody
giving

hall fame consideration players todays standards
marginal

whom you talking about yes eddie murray marginal thats
because hes years old he wasnt marginal long time

honestly ozzie smith robin yount dont belong theyre both

shortstops just hung around long time big deal

 

smith has hung around long time fielded position better 
than anyone else ever has

yount stopped being shortstop about decade ago case you hadnt 
noticed

one his two mvp awards centerfielder

 lets little more selective huh stop handing out honors
so

liberally save them guys who really deserve face 

like whom many players hall who arent anywhere near
 goos guys youre running down

something
isnt done little prestige hall fame anymore when

thats already case some standards bad players 
hall all from s s recent picks have generally been
excellent

certain individuals believe steve garvey jack morris potential
candidates absurdity apparent gee can guys even compare 
 more likely future hall famers like kirby puckett nolan ryan

 who cares stan musial anywhere near good babe ruth
 really he obviously belongs 

 hall has generally had about top major leaguers 
more players come through game more top 

 yes its pretty easy argue smith yount evans winfield
etc top dave kingman other hand liability
throughout most his career

 course garvey hasnt gotten lot hof press so i dont know
what you mean 

 ryan his wl better than morris thats what lot voters
tend look morris awfully good decade doesnt
lead mlb history walks allowed either
