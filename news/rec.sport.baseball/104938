 major league baseball trying expand its appeal people shorter
 attention spans ie football crowd invariably all 
 arguments from people who dont like watch baseball tv say 
 same thing games too long too boring baseball trying
 find way shorten games wider tv appeal you look 
 though baseball games last around same amount time football
 games difference more action duration 
 football games perhaps were more action baseball games you
 would get more those fans tune anyway coming up solution
 make baseball more appealing bigger crowd going difficult
 soapbox yet another reason get commisioner now since its obvious
 ruling baseball comittee works about fast snail race 
 nebraska off soapbox
 
 how can you say more action football baseball football
 game consists approximately plays average duration play
 around seconds means game lasts approximately 
 hours you have about minute s action baseball game you have
 upwards two hundred pitches very few field strategy 
 field stratgy sessions ie huddles you always have chance win
 until last out made 
 
 

ah illusion football always lots action 
 sense urgency because game clock all time happens
when theres less than minutes go quite often sense creates
drama even when may necessarily any holds viewers
attention baseball only players involved action about
here comes wild guess time theyre just playing 
sophisticated game catchholdtheballstepoutoftheboxadjustchains
touchselfininterestinglocations theres lot dead time 
players warming up between innings manager visiting pitcher 
mound manager removing pitcher bringing relief pitcher
who takes pitches helen dell playing organ dodger fans
 appreciate one non baseball junkie boring
 any rate im putting baseball down ive been avid
fan since i can remember its just watching baseball game 
tv home can tedious non baseball junkie thats what major
league baseball networks trying address when talk 
shortening game its because tv because football has more
action than baseball
