 ideally dhs should strongest offensive players because
 any schmoe can play dh he can hit would take care position
 corrected anomolies franks since case why
 always way we going have trouble finding 
 true value dhs using same models position players

 several reasons difference main reason 
good hitters prime frank thomas danny tartabull
 rarely regular dhs even cant field its more commonly 
place put aging veterans

another use dh slot help player come back from injury
slowly getting his bat lineup without forcing him play 
field i would expect players hit worse dhs than did
during rest season

 third factor most player who split time between dh first
 outfield dont hit well dhs some reason reggie
jackson good example five years rfdh angels he
hit like old reggie when he right

 second third factors lost players considered 
 primary position only player who plays games right 
 dh count only right fielders averages

 logical starting place would look defensive replacement
 value you can find b lf something we can assume 
 forced play defense would play true zero value even though i
 doubt actually true players like winfield molitor 
 would let us discount time spend playing dh because 
 forces team find another real fielder play

 makes sense you might also look another way although 
average offensive performance dh may lower than left
fielder replacementlevel offensive performance certainly
lower you left fielder cant hit well enough keep job
anywhere you certainly cant hit well enough keep job dh
