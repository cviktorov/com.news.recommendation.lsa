winfield cant touch frank robinson mel ott far i can tell 
youd also have hard time convincing me rate him better than 
equal clemente 

two sets numbers career equivalent average equivalent runs

 ruth 
 aaron 
 ott 
 robinson 

 clemente 
 winfield 

ruth class himself both rate eqa total eqr
performance aaron runs over everybody total category ott 
robinson who lead winfield both categories could safely put
ahead ahead him reggie too although he barely ahead 
numbers normalized league park clemente held down 
some really anemic offensive production his earliest years 
still productive when he died reasonably safe assume he had
 runs more he could have gotten still jackson waner
clemente winfield form pretty tight knot


yes 

 we were talking about peak level career averages

b clemente best fielding rf all time far
 anyone can tell

i did quick scan last night looking players peak comparable
 better than winfield my quickndirty subjective judgement you
could make good cases ruth aaron ott robinson clemente kaline 
maris klein jackson waner probably few others 
knock winfield comment his consistency all those other
players had awesome stretches very good stretches while winfield has
been more uniformly excellent hall fame absolutely top peak
im so sure top total career value yes almost certainly


 
 david m tate my free agent says he ones mine
