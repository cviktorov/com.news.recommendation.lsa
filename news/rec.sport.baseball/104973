ive been braves fan long ive been watching baseball almost 
years now i say just tp preface what im about post

 braves team made up slow starters people amazed 
braves arent hitting dont werent hitting last year 
time nor were year before had slow aprils mays 
 seasons yet still managed go series 
those years well team different so why should we suprised
 slow start started way past two years 
theyll way until richmond club makes majors judge
 offense june july when things start average out im just
happy reds have gotten off poor start giants always
do well early part season theyll out race 
july just like last few years unless bonds developes knuckelball
 staff get rocked midjune 

wow you really know how hurt guy guess i shouldnt bother watching
any more games its already been decided
