sigh here we go again 

you started 

 predicting future has been entirely meaningless least
 has meaning we dont know how find 

i did say i could predict future

you most certainly did

nonclutchclutch 
abhbaabhba
sabo
samuel

sabo clearly better hitter than samuel yet you would pinchhit
samuel because you predict samuel clutch hitter 
sabo choke hitter right id call predicting 
future

 you were have been reds manager time i assume you
would have had some basis letting sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting samuel im sure some basis would have utilized
prior performance you just wouldnt have used particular
aspect prior performance correct

right i would have used aspects prior performance which have been
shown consistent past overall performance lr splits
even matching hittingpitching styles all give me some
advantage used properly

even all else were equal would advantage gained 
looking past clutch performance case everything else
pointed sabo

one more time i did claim able predict future
i said i accept above data indication samuel would
have had better chance success situation than sabo

 comes down same thing when perez left sabo he
 predicting future next ab he predicting 
sabo more likely get hit than samuel

 supporting swap you predicting opposite

 i am dismissing your work im stating my opinion
you saying your work renders any opinion contrary
invalid so retention opinion some kind insult
 your work

well yes you aware its existance you claim incapable
 understanding though i suspect you simply unwilling yet
you rather forcefully state opposite you dont seem think 
work worth reading yet you obviously feel topic important
id say insulting

i did say consistent skill

i have said indicator performance under 
certain set circumstances

right beef has proven indicator 
future performance under any circumstances least none 
weve been able come up you know some where 
indicator future performance please let us your secret

 nice however see you consider possibility
 you actually could have some preconceived biases

most certainly i have repeatedly stated you can come up 
 study which even hints consistent clutch ability i would
love however straightforward attempts study have
all failed miserably

yeah hindsight always doesnt make you bright 
 stupid argument you know 

ah i knew we could get name calling theres word
you like so much

well stupid argument you honestly debating 
sure we know sabo didnt get hit we have idea whether samuel
would have done any better one ab most certainly doesnt
prove anything

i believe 
seasons end chris sabos batting average clutch situations
 significantly lower than his batting average nonclutch
situations i cant prove happen so i guess well 
just have wait see

 simply prediction chris sabo year 
 prediction all batters who have over past few years hit
xxx amount worse clutch than overall

 you mean first you say well just have wait 
see second much stronger statement fact 
suggests rule we can test rule past data see 
worked recent years i think you agree rule
didnt work last year year before unlikely do
any better year right

heres another one you joe carters batting
average clutch situations significantly below his batting
average nonclutch situations each year i presume you think
 random 

im going get case analysis sure you can find somebody
who hit poorly from hit poorly well you
can also find those who hit poorly from hit well 


 doesnt prove any overall statistical trend can
 used predict future performance across breadth 
major league ballplayers just makes me think 
joe carters batting average clutch going 
 high his ba nonclutch situations

gamblers fallacy unless reason expect consistency 
run proves nothing can you give us reason expect clutch ba 
correlate from one year next ive seen detailed study 
why i shouldnt expect correlate

stupid total idiot 

my my hostility

 stupid reference statement which stupid 
i dont see how you can deny total idiot yes you
prove yourself unwilling even consider evidence might
suggest you wrong i would say term fits nicely

so tell me does term fit do you have open mind
