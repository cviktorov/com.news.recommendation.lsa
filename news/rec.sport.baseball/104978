mattingly scores badly both counts he doesnt get very many
balls he lets lot balls go through fact he looks
smooth has great hands makes few errors means nothing 
traditional brainless reliance observations can easily 
misled like lot bad fielders mattingly actually makes himself
look better having any range hes nowhere near bad steve
garvey thats much compliment 

i agree flavor post disagree one specific
argument has great hands means nothing seems me 
 firstbasemans defensive value entirely even primarily
from his ability field grounders catch popups how many 
chances does he get during game many fewer than he gets chances
 catch throws from bssb p i mean total 
much higher than grounderpopup totals implies me 
 value catching throws well even high uptheline
 dirt good hands needed plays thus have
value i dont have any numbers relative number occurences
 plays id guess values abilities 
similar its just like you dont judge catchers defense primarily
 how field bunts popups marked i suppose
