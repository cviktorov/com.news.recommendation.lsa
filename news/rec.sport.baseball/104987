 giants have won last games behind some solid pitching
excluding win against atlanta can stay around first
place after say first games i think theyve got legitimate chance
 winning pennant maybe even more than 

dont you remember giants were st place late 
june last year pitching collapsed problem
 have optimistically only good starting pitchers
swiftbrantlyand bowlercant remember his name 
other starters extremely unreliable often get blasted
before innings means already shallow bullpen gets
over worked means after few months bullpen collapses
 postallstar record tends much worst than
 preallstar record 

 bowler john burkett who went last night he 
 bargain pickup my roto team i got him minimum 

 just thought does someone have wonlost prepost
allstar records giants last few seasons i bet
 records tends worst worst season goes 

 really true excluding last season giants
has been better nd half team had hot august
 pull within few games braves dodgers before
fading september
 giants may go back earth fast last
season two reasons
 barry bonds
 roger craig longer manager dusty can manage
 his pitching staffs much better than craig
