note im posting part argument roger meynard
 independent sort thread i do actually quote some things
 roger meynard wrote might better think 
sampling his post hiphop sense because fits what
i want say

lates teams individual players method
inherent baseball comparing individual performances 
 how should because after all baseball team game

theres interesting parallel between way viewing baseball
team some peoples conception biological organism 
biology context we would very likely read fitness score 
 game organisms teams how we interpret players 
trickier either organs genes might seem reasonable
choices depending what point we were trying make genes
interpretation actually might really interesting case 
 would different probably longer post

 however we take organ view our knowledge biology
should make us pause before we start saying things like species x 
more fit than species y because better organ z given what we
know about interdependence organs we would often suspicious
 claims note type argument quite often
made when you map species x onto humans organ z onto
brain other hand some statements kind do seem
more reasonable than others far we can test them eg brain
above might more reasonable than pancreas assuming gross
pathology particularly species y primate

even when you make statements you should concerned 
functioning whole organism possibility one organ
might more crucial one species second organ another
 mention possibility organ particularly crucial
 some third species however we nonvitalists any
kind reductionsit streak we want say organism 
 some completely magical unanalyzable whole intriguing
process made up various subprocesses interact ways 
potentially observable some processes might localized 
particular organs while others may distributed across multiple
organs way just like baseball team except i
think pretty clear processes interactions involved
 baseball much simpler less numerous than most organisms

 say one player better than another able say ab
solutely player team would have played better player b
 lineup sheer speculation impossible ascertain

one thing quite difficult about baseball perfectly
controlled experiments sometimes very tough do 
course has never stopped researchers from doing best 
can sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even 
absence certainty most goes far beyond sheer speculation
 even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research

 you want select group statistics claim clemens
has done better than another pitcher those statistics 
criteria fine

 cases were seeing word statistics means summary 
observed events where events themselves can viewed 
output some process possibly inputs other processes
thus we have any valid notion how processes put together
 functioning organism data form statistics might
give us basis test particular hypotheses

 you have able prove those statistics measure 
individuals contribution winning ws because only
measure best has any meaning context baseball

 statement brings us back concept fitness again
fitness defined terms both organism its environment
you might fit one situation another moving 
baseball clear each team spends entire season 
environment including all other teams league least
 nominal sense division winners fittest teams 
league average had better fitness scores than any
 competing opponennts real sense fairly
large random component performance each team 
difficult impossible account terms factors
intrinsic interesting baseball same true 
biology here also direct biological equivalent 
world series basebal world series random component
may greatly magnified small number games played
 both teams suddenly experience huge changes from environement
where were originally successful might fun watch 
its unclear what all really means



now just one more unrelated point

i have yet see any you can predict 
ws winner any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon

 other hand you have seen some us who can predict 
outcome divisional races better than random assignment 
teams finishes maybe some us eg me who can do 
better than other participants forum regular basis
 probably only due fact game schedule
gives you little hope bad hops arent only difference
between winners losers

moreover youve had opportunity see some analysis world
series situation makes strong claim nobody can predict
 ws winner reliably greater accuracy than coin biased only
 reflect wellknown home vs road effect winning percentage

 stats nice hobby thats about new
knowledge being produced 

since stats summaries events its true you know 
events you can derive stats somebody trying 
understand process behind stats stats produce new
knowledge some might even reliable repeatable 
useful speaking which i should get back producing knowledge
 different field course i can produce knowledge
even though im relying stats do
