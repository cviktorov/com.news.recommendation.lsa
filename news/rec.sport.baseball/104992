based only data i dont see any reason 
pinchhit sabo any other player who had been poor clutch
hitter past

 many other factors involved decision pinchhit
does pinchhitter give you platoon advantage any portion 
sabos clutch split results from his platoon split certainly 
real ability even has nothing do clutch hitting do you
have singles hitter plate when you need home run do you
have curveball pitcher facing batter who has trouble curves


hey whats we agree

 platoon advantage sabo vs samuel

both players have reputation being excellent fastball hitters
 both have reputation being fooled too often 
slow curves change ups

sabo has more power little bit better batting eye samuel
 noted agressive freeswinger sabo has more homerun power

both players started game hitting below 

 may have been some game considerations might have prompted
perez want reserve samuel use later game
 line samuel never did get 

given all i dont see lot suggest pinchhitting nor do
i see anything suggest pinchhitting course 
clutchhitting information thats useless

 again its
