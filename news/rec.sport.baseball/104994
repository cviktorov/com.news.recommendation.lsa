 wade boggs
 i live boston like wade lot his career 
 winding down i would rather see yanks start develop
 long term solution ie hensley muelins russ davis velarde
 besides wade just doesnt have any range what shame about
 charlie hayes huh
who would you have playing b wade boggs charlie hayes my choice
 boggs contest give them time develop younger talent
 area yankee farm system seems deficient
 
 ahem two words russell davis playing cavern albany aa last
 year down alleys center davis went 
 homers arent any small parks road eastern
 league either hes his mle hr i have 
 fielding statistics from seeing him number times last year id say
 hes brooks robinson neither he howard johnson unless 
 think can win pennant year which seems possible need
 boggs do i think theyre making same sort mistake davis
 boston made boggs leaving him minors two three
 years after hed shown he good hitter
 
 spike owen
 see wade boggs id much rather see them develop dave silvestri
 whoever wade spike next each other infield 
 going raise yankee staff era point guys
 down sides careers
too bad gave up randy valarde too many trips columbus
shuttle
 
 hrm still have him roster ab through first two weeks
 theyve just never figured out what do him i suspect he hits
 enough especially vs lefties reasonable shortstop one rumor
 running around during spring training wanted convert
 silvestri catcher because his body type wrong 
 shortstop youd think somebody same division who plays
 baltimore about dozen times year would know better

 one our guys went down i just doubled confusion 
 didnt require rhodes scholar two my teammates went down four 
 yours would i had protect my guys
 don drysdale


 regard boggs ill relate story about yankee fan fenway last year
 opening day i see them face baltimore couldnt help 
listen boston fans talk about various players team one guy 
totally obliterating boggs how he sucks etc i told him i yankee
fan id take him second who would he want trade back he
said pile sht i know boggs had some personal problems while playing 
boston come hes future hall famer who really adds needed
dimension yanks solid hitter decent fielder more importantly
 teacher ask pat kelly i think hes got few good years left his bat
 may key contributor down stretch win american league
east year boston fans have class theyll probably boo him like
crazy his first time back pinstripes i hope he goes shuts
them up
