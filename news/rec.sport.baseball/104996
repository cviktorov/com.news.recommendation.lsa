 true note i dont think lasorda should 
fired least two reasons

 publicly humiliating his players
 knuckling under his players wishes

i did write fact those statements were rebuttal 
 earlier posting i made culled from my strong
rebuttal those statements please slander shame


 fine line between getting players input knuckling
under players demands manager much like military officer
needs have his her players complete obedience respect during
 game after game its big deal when time 
 do more than react players must trust manager team often
falls apart see boston red sox ff 


after game its big deal after employees leave
 workplace doesnt matter what say about boss 
company puhlease


strawberrys demeanor represented media often sounds like
demands i suspect comment like i enjoy hitting fourth im
used would get pretty brutally misinterpreted media 
 came from strawberry russ porter quoted strawberry saying
i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup i think i perform best
 role paraphrased my memory bias seems like
 fairly nonpetulant answer what almost certainly question 
like how do you feel about being moved third spot order


first its ross porter second i am really tired seeing kind
 response indicates all i do parrot what some media
person says writes i have brain i choose characterize
something certain fashion its because what i believe
 accurate just because some unnamed mediot made
 characterization 

 more mediasensitive player might answer manager knows what he 
doing he thinks batting me third help team i
am all wed ignore answer brown stuff so seems 
little bit overreaction brand darryls response petulant

i did brand darryls response petulant because i never heard
any response from darryl i did call him name i referred him 
 primadonna someone else concluded i did because i
hate him i dont hate him i think hes primadonna you
disagree fine stop putting words my mouth
