 beat dead horse i seem remember fair amount sympathy 
some black fringe player named roberto clemente roy 
campanella thurman munson just about anyone else 
who we may even have liked players mourned dying too young

wiggins alan

i believe he well out baseball time he died

 thats besides point im sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic rickey he were killed would also 
criticizing him lot more his actions

example 

how about jose canseco he gets couple speeding tickets all
 sudden his attitude awful what hell do speeding tickets
have do clubhouse influence anyway so why do sportswriters
talk about all time

uh he also has been charged chasing his wife car smashing 
 tree well carrying loaded firearm his car 
speeding reported over mph reckless driving

 brian hunter keith mitchell both whom had dwi problems
towards end last year two years ago cited sign
 immaturity etc 

actually i hadnt heard about thanks

meanwhile dykstra almost killed both himself daulton i didnt
read any sportswriter complaining about may have talked
about how bad phillies i never read anywhere
criticism dykstras character daultons intelligence 
matter based incident

i dont know what you were reading watching i sure saw lot about 
 about dykstras poker games most writing along lines
 how incredibly stupid selfish how hed hurt team 
wracking himself catcher up etc espn raised questions about his
judgement etc print media here sf area questioned why disciplinary
action wouldnt taken against dykstra one article pointed out 
lenny wanted kill himself were ways wouldnt endanger other
peoples lives dykstra himself being quoted how stupid 
 etc
