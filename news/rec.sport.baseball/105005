just wondering friend i were talking other day 
we were some reason trying come up names jewish
baseball players past present we werent able come up
 much except sandy koufax somebody stankowitz 
maybe john lowenstein can anyone come up any more i know
 sounds pretty lame racking our brains over 
humor us thanks your help

hank greenberg would have most famous because his jewish
faith actually affected his play missing late season world
series games because yom kippur

 other jewish hofer rod carew who converted 

did he ever really convert he married jewish woman ive never
heard him say he converted elliot maddox other hand

lowenstein jewish well montanas only representative 
major leagues

undeserving cy young award winner steve stone jewish between stone
koufax ken holtzman might have wrong pitcher im thinking 
one who threw nohitter both al nl big ed reulbach
thats quite starting rotation moe berg can catch harry steinfeldt
 b tinkerseverschance infield

yep holtzman saul rogovin won era title so before blowing out
 arm

 stanky jewish just dave cohen kinda misinterpretation
whatever doesnt look like he stuck around majors too long

id surprised btw may just shopping gallego around 
make room
