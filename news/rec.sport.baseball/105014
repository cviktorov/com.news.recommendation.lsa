 spanky too slow he were quicker he would still here
 slaught tom prince didnt want lose prince order
 bring up th pitcher slaught about good spanky 
 prince coming along nicely
 
 tom prince year old nohit catcher think him young dann
 bilardello 

 young don bordello

 i cant begin fathom why pirates have been so afraid 
 losing guy whos been aaa most last seasons pirates
 released kirk gibson last year because prince out options 
 eventually sent prince down anyway he cleared waivers without peep
 hes another year older still cant hit why do think he wouldnt
 clear waivers now why would care

theres strong possibility bucs have absolutely other catching 
prospects minors point least nobody ready any serious 
aaamajors duty main reason might have stayed prince could 
just age especially spanky creeping toward his mids something
 
all things considered though id lot more comfortable spanky behind 
 plate than prince isnt decent backup backstop out looking 
 work
