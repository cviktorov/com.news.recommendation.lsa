some evidence working

take look standings its real easy get so focussed 
minutinae forget giants happen first place its
working you dont screw up changing things just because you think 
ought different

so reason why toronto blue jays should keep alfredo
griffin just because worked

 team winning doesnt mean everything its doing right
 team winning doesnt mean everything its doing wrong 
otherwise borrow sharks situation you would say george kingston
should fired

some folks like argue about theoretical details i prefer watch teams
win when giants slip third we can talk about how rearrange
 batting order until i think its stupid focus whats wrong
 simple fact its working 

 its too late problem fixing something while its
working may anything left fix

mostly though giants winning frankly long 
continues its rather silly secondguess strategy evidently
some folks would rather right than first

so blue jays were simply perfect last year nothing 
could have done have improved team 


go california angels
