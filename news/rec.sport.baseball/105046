while were multipurpose subject lets forget shea which
 designed accommodate both mets jets first
stadium i think have box seats rollers so could 
oriented right angles baseball parallel football

minor point shea stadium designed multipurpose stadium 
 jets mind tennant new york football giants
had moved yankee stadium from polo grounds 
having problem stadium management city did own yankee
stadium until idea get giants move shea
when deal worked out between giants yankees 
new afl franchise new york titans approached city about using
 new stadium titans were playing downing stadium where 
cosmos played soccer s because shea stadium tied 
 worlds fair anyway city thought would novel idea 
promote new franchise worlds fair like were doing
 mets so deal worked out

 course jets gone jersey truly good football
stadium mets saddled multipurpose stadium where
because its circular seats almost always too far from 
action mets announcerskiner murphy particularhave
always hyped beautiful shea
stadium tipoff how unbeautiful truly 

im under impression when murph says he means 
regular goer shea bad place since theyve cleaned 
renovated place remember its th year
