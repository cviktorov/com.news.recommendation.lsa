 subject line says all what rule qualifies
 pitcher making save
imho most untrustworthy silly stat todays rules all 
 baseball my understanding qualify save pitcher cannot 
pitch more than three innings potential tying run must least 
appear ondeck circle also lead pitcher enters cannot 
excede three runs

 phenomenon known around work readyfireaim i am astounded 
 number times people post strong opinions about things only
dont understand publicly admit understanding fact theres 
plausible argument saves more rational stat than wins

 record two ways reliever can get save
he must finish game either
 have entered game tying run base bat deck
 have pitched least three innings effectively
 pitcher may get win save same game

i believe official scorers must assert more authority 
determining winnerssaversetc instance pitcher can come 
ninth lead blow lead fall behind have his team come back 
 next half inning earn win has pitcher earned win 
way

 argument wins dumb stat saves

i guy could pitch five strong innings middle relief see his 
teammates rally tie score assume he came start fourth 
 left after eighth his teammate holds opposition scoreless 
 ninth score run bottom ninth win 
third pitcher earns win middle reliever gets stat 
satisfaction

 again doesnt support your claim about saves beginning your
