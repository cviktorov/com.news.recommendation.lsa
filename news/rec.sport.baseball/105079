 predicting future has been entirely meaningless least
 has meaning we dont know how find 

i did say i could predict future

you most certainly did

i really dont want get didsodidnot debate you 
 somewhat heart our disagreement i did say 
nor did i imply i could predict future you have inferred
 my comments meant you have based your rebuttal my
comments fact statistical studies have demonstrated 
 reasonable basis predicting future performance 
regard clutch hitting


sabo
samuel

sabo clearly better hitter than samuel yet you would pinchhit
samuel because you predict samuel clutch hitter 
sabo choke hitter right id call predicting 
future

 your opinion sabo clearly better hitter than
samuel above data year period ending last season
last season samuel batted while sabo hit park adjusted
 season both hitting below albeit sabo more
 bats i agree over his career sabo has been better
hitter than samuel i also remind you samuel has been
 better hitter certain situations than sabo

i did predict sabo would choke nor samuel would get 
hit i expressed my opinion had i been reds manager 
even reds fan i would prefer have samuel hit 
situation than sabo


 you were have been reds manager time i assume you
would have had some basis letting sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting samuel im sure some basis would have utilized
prior performance you just wouldnt have used particular
aspect prior performance correct

right i would have used aspects prior performance which have been
shown consistent past overall performance lr splits
even matching hittingpitching styles all give me some
advantage used properly

ah properly yes i see

even all else were equal would advantage gained 
looking past clutch performance case everything else
pointed sabo

please help me what exactly everything else pointed sabo


well yes you aware its existance you claim incapable
 understanding though i suspect you simply unwilling yet
you rather forcefully state opposite you dont seem think 
work worth reading yet you obviously feel topic important
id say insulting

i must say i aware publication can you email me 
information regarding its availability

 i guess i must apologize all those who have done extensive 
study say supply side economics i didnt mean insult you
 i never did believe you were right path im sorry 
my contrary opinionposition i also regret i dont have 
ability prove you wrong you 
 

i believe 
seasons end chris sabos batting average clutch situations
 significantly lower than his batting average nonclutch
situations i cant prove happen so i guess well 
just have wait see

 simply prediction chris sabo year 
 prediction all batters who have over past few years hit
xxx amount worse clutch than overall

 what says 

 you mean first you say well just have wait 
see second much stronger statement fact 
suggests rule we can test rule past data see 
worked recent years i think you agree rule
didnt work last year year before unlikely do
any better year right


 second your statement mine


im going get case analysis sure you can find somebody
who hit poorly from hit poorly well you
can also find those who hit poorly from hit well 


well actually i havent yet im finished looking
 i havent yet found someone who hit significantly below
his overall batting average clutch situations years 
 reversed relationship 


gamblers fallacy unless reason expect consistency 
run proves nothing can you give us reason expect clutch ba 
correlate from one year next ive seen detailed study 
why i shouldnt expect correlate

nope sorry you were interested reason why i expect
chris sabos ability hit clutch correlate from one
year next i think i could you were interested 
reason why i expect joe carters ability hit clutch 
correlate from one year next i think i could youre
 interested because you think those conclusions
could only valid could extrapolated over entire
baseball population cant 


 stupid reference statement which stupid 
i dont see how you can deny total idiot yes you
prove yourself unwilling even consider evidence might
suggest you wrong i would say term fits nicely

 problem here i do believe you i accept your work
i believe trying predict future clutch performance based
 prior clutch history meaningless better than coin toss
i actually do accept your work

 happens i also have opinion certain situations
 certain players history superior inferior ability 
hit clutch might suggest reason what history could 
valid projecting future player performance player
 chris sabo one player


so tell me does term fit do you have open mind

well since i defer your statistical wisdom i think i must have
 open mind now we have pose same question you
