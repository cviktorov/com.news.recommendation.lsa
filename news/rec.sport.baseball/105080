my supposition we were find same players
consistently year after year one end bell other
 we might able make some reasonable conclusions about
those players opposed all baseball players

 may root confusion

please consider following hypothetical open mind note
 i am yet saying has anything do 
question hand

suppose we have simplified lotto game

detailed explanation deleted


indeed you have struck right heart our disagreement 
rebut my opinion you have made analogy game chance
your hypothesis assumes lotto players have impact 
 selection numbers hence ability win

well thats certainly true lotto has absolutely
nothing do sport baseball when you start down
 wrong path you finish down wrong path





i repeat i do think statistical analysis prior clutch
hitting performance accurate predictor future clutch hitting
performance

i do however think analysis prior clutch hitting performance
may some players indicate deficiency game indeed
 provide basis projecting particular future performance
 i think chris sabo player
