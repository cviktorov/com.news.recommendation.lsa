right so who cares which player gets credited long team
gets more runs player helps team get more r rbi 
doesnt score them all himself who cares

amusing isnt seems only sdcns realize how much baseball 
 team game combining efforts from every player win

consider red sox game last night sox won bottom
 th who won game

clemens pitched strong nine innings allowing only two runs
ryan pitched couple shutout innings though he needed some excellent
 defensive plays behind him do so
quantrill pitched couple innings gave up goahead run 
 got credited win when sox scored two bottom 
 inning

looks like team effort me yet only quantrill got credit 
 win

how about offense
dawson vaughn hit i think hrs early game without either
 one sox would have lost nine
quintana led off th solid single
zupcic pinchran quintana providing speed go from first
 third when
cooper ripped second single inning
melvin avoided dp getting run home sac fly much 
 help something
scrub richardson hit double scoring speedy cooper all 
 way from first hills lack defense helped

cooper zupcic were credited runs melvin richardson were
credited rbis seems me quintanas hit
 set up whole inning did melvin really contribute 
much richardson

furthermore people seem consider rbis more significant than
runs did melvin contribute more than cooper cooper provided 
gamewinning baserunner moved tying run third base 
only one out

assigning credit based runs rbis clearly ridiculous you
can argue obp slg dont show you who came through 
clutch rrbi dont do any better least obp slg dont
claim try tell you 

heres red sox who contributed last nights victory
all them
