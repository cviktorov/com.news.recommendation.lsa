did you see same game i saw gant most reasonable argued 
horrible call which hirschbeck correctly did nothing about gant
 proceeded walk halfway rd base lean his bat 
glare hirschbeck while i dont necessasarily subscribe 
theory showing people up obvious attempt gant 
do so hirschbeck he left hirschbeck choice take control
 situation bottom line gant started dangerous
power struggle hirschbeck when his team needed him most 
he lost


 events i saw were
 called strike hirschbeck

 just me did look like hirschbeck pointed 
 b umpire before calling strike i thought thats
why gant asking appeal st base umpire
he thought hirschbeck had gotten checkedswing help from wrong
umpire

 shockedlooking gant asks appeal first
 appeal first
 gant steps out batters box
 hirschbeck immediately orders gant back bad move
 gant ignores hirschbeck walks off bad move
 hirschbeck yells gant gant silent
 hirschbeck calls pitch

after hirschbeck called pitch before pitch thrown
cox came onto field obvious he trying get time
called before pitch one watching

 pitch called strike
 cox argues couldnt see when he came field
 cox ejected players everywhere
 play finally resumes


gant shouldnt have ignored hirschbeck returning made strike
call fairly likely although i suspect argument might have gotten
gant tossed altogether hirschbeck had let gant step out 
whole incident probably would have been avoided

your listing pretty much agreed what i saw aforementioned
addendums perhaps appeared differently ballpark personally
i amazed gant didnt get ejected thats why cox did
its called protecting your players

 those people who would have thrown everyone out game
all i can say youd making baseball history even 
 worst baseball brawls usually only major instigators 
ejected everyone who comes onto field id have 
say those brawls considerably more threatening game
 than what braves did fri night

anyhow thats my last two cents subject barring
outrageous postings i try keep my eyes open
 more incidents involving hirschbeck i think 
 some other teams well i hope
