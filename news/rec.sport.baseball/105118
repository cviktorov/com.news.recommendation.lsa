rule k states interference batter runner when 
 running last half distance from home base first base
 he runs outside threefoot line inside left 
 foul line umpires judgment interferes field
er taking throw first base

 key word rule runner isnt out just running
out baseline hes out interfering fielding 
ball throw fielding throw first because catcher
opted throw ball over batterrunners head theres inter
ference

sorry i still dont buy youre certainly right runner 
 out merely running out baseline he must interfere 
 play argument here over what constitutes interference
you certainly cannot infer from what youve quoted batterrunner
must hit ball guilty interference you havent posted
 definition interference all

imo calls one approved rulings go small print
 rulebook something like

approved ruling
 judgement umpire runner running left
 allowed path caused fielder make bad throw blocks 
vision fielder receiving throw otherwise impedes 
defensive teams making play him batterrunner shall 
judeged guilty interference



approved ruling
 runner cannot judged guilty interference unless he makes
contact fielder hit thrown ball


 absence approved ruling i claim poor
rules trivia questionsince cannot authoritatively answered
