i think everything else being equal its too much ask 
 weeknight game can shortened halfanhour cutting out warmup
pitches dawdling outside batters box commercial timeouts 
sort thing im asking too much

how do you know can shortened halfanhour has anybody done 
study determine how much time actually wasted say 
games

oh probably

ms nichols has given average game times average runs scored 
 very nice piece information ms nichols who knows
she may listening have me her kill file after all those
numbers indicate somewhere neighborhood halfarun less being
scored per game games taking minutes longer something 
being done now wasnt done ten years ago which extending games
 minutes ms nichols thinks its more pitches given increasing
specialization pitchers wouldnt surprise me

 its simply more pitches though i dont think its unreasonable
 think something can done get ten those minutes back 
i get couple more from shortening warmup time relief pitcher
after he comes couple more still from enforcing existing rules
which have been stated other posts thread other related ones

 problem who decides whether time wasted you dont seem
 think all right now i think although i have heard one
case favoring giving reliever all warmups he thinks he needs 
difference mounds between field pen who knows 
rules get changed maybe something i didnt foresee happen change my
mind you can bet lot minds would fail foresee same thing
 else nothing changed
