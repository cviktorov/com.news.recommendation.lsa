ielding rf all time far
 anyone can tell

 i did quick scan last night looking players peak 
comparable
 better than winfield my quickndirty subjective judgement 
you
 could make good cases ruth aaron ott robinson clemente kaline 
 maris klein jackson waner probably few others 
 knock winfield comment his consistency all those other
 players had awesome stretches very good stretches while winfield 
has
 been more uniformly excellent hall fame absolutely top peak
 im so sure top total career value yes almost certainly

point taken when winfields peak years anyway probably around 

thats trouble what peak years he wavers between excellent 
very good real bellshaped pattern fine
year were merely really good yankees i think
 best one ba 

 course wasnt bad either hes been bigs since 
 oneyear intermission surgery though he doesnt have 
mix skills pete rose did hes like pete rose one way hes 
 natural hitter winfields swing used ugliest thing
 new york includes gulfwestern building his sheer
athletic prowess physical size made up lot 

fascinating player watch even now obviously great any one
way able do quite few things surprising ways surprising
levels
