 weeks play
 

 took three days get us ill try anyway i naturally
havent seen answer

 runners first second one out batter hits 
 easy pop fly third baseman
 
 umpires declare infield fly rule third baseman
 lets ball drop runner second heads third 
 third baseman flips ball short stop who tags bag
 before runner

safe correct call infield fly batter out fair runners
may advance own risk gotta tag up caught etc 
force pop caught so regardless whether ss
tags b b wasnt clear above he hasnt got runner out

 b umpires dont declare infield fly rule third
 baseman allows ball drop throws short stop who
 tags runner from second while runner between second 
 third

out see rule l approved ruling below case 
umpire has decided whatever reason infield fly rule
doesnt apply sounds like bad call here thats 
point batter out so force situation created
therefore runner out unless rule l ball 
dead batter safe i guess runners would advance
unmolested i cant really tell from l ball dead 
 situation

 
 whats call b

pertinent rules definition infield fly when infield fly
 called runners may advance own risk infield fly
rule infielder intentionally drops fair ball ball remains
 play despite provisions rule l infield fly rule
takes precedence

l batter out when infielder intentionally drops fair
fly ball line drive first first second first thrid
 firstsecond third base occupied before two out ball
 dead runners runners shall return original base
 bases approved ruling situation batter out 
 infielder permits ball drop untouched ground
except when infield fly rule applies
