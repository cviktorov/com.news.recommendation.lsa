 huckabays counting frames bat speed discussion ommited

 
 well its just studying tape frame frame thats all biggest
 thing you notice however how bastardized strike zone has 
 become death umpires union plate across
 call high strikes strikes quit calling pitches 
 outside strikes theyre balls
 

 speaking wide strike zone

 id sure like see cameras placed each major league park 
 overview shot home plate available cbs had during 
 ws did i just dream 

 pictures would feedback device umpires so can
 see just how terrible calls were tapes could sent 
 league evidence bad ballstrike umpiring tapes available
 evidence bad outsafe calls bases

i guess nobody noticed calls during world series 
fact all year have been pretty much consistently correct remember rule
says its strike any part ball passes through strike zone

i would certainly agree high strikes called who could argue
 point all all i think out called pretty well
