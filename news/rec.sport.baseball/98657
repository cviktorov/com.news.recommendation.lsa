i heard eli selling team group cinninati would
help so os could make some real free agent signings 
offseason training camp reports everything pretty positive right
now backup catcher postion showdown between tackett parent
although i would prefer parent draft pick jeff hammonds may coming
up faster os hierarchy minors faster than expected mike
flanagan trying another comeback big ben being defended 
coaches saying while homers given up were awful lot most came
 beginning season he really improved second half 
may bens year 
i feel while may mussinas cy young year he 
 able pitch entire season without periods fatigue like last year
around august i really hope baines can provide rf support os need
orsulak decent i had hoped chito martinez could learn defense
better play like he did os right now dont have many
lefthanded hitters anderson proving last year fluke cals return
 his averages would big plusses drive pennant 
rotation should sutcliffe mussina mcdonald rhodes olson 
interesting case he strike out side load bases get
three pop outs you never know
 way i see al east year personal biases mixed 
baltimore
new york
toronto
milwaukee
cleveland
boston
detroit
 top only true contenders my mind one 
definitely win division unless snows hellmaryland i feel
 baltimores season finally put everything together
