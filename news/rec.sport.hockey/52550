when pens got mario granted big publicity etc etc
 interest immediately generated gretzky did same thing la 
however imnsho neither team would have seen marked improvement 
attendance team record did improve year before lemieux
came pittsburgh finished points following his arrival pens
finished points couple 
 
stanley cups thrown 
 
 point pens attendance near capacity out 
sellouts yet hadnt made playoffs since how do you explain
 th place team breaking attendance records when havent been 
playoffs years mario lemieux explanation imho 

you could make case expectation improving team 
would make playoffs reason 

funny you should mention itthis exactly case i going make

 i think reason lemieux
had point season first nongretzky win hart 
ross since people turned out watch him play 

i grant star like mario draw fans even team sucks 
 short term only i still do think attendance increase 
 last unless team winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking
one pittsburgh still getting better so people continued support
them suddenly dropped say points youd have knee surgery
 some people jumping off bandwagon 

also following year pens had points 

ok my numbers came from nhl guide record book 

 made transaction try build winner around mario 
true improvement attendance came before started doing
 coffey late before even had playoff bound team
 doubling attendance occured from previous year 
increase from points points going do arrival
 mario lemieux what did 

you can give credit mario since he deserves my point 
 wasnt mario himself expectation things come ie
 winning team he created being next great hockey superstar 
before anybody jumps says im nitpicking mincing words go back
 read from where thread started

 might help think about what would go through fans mind who suddenly
found interest mario pens gee mario lemieux 
amazing ill go watch him play gee now weve got kick
ass guy our side ill go watch him play i think latter

 similar thing happened la before
gretzkys arrival about per game after constant sellouts 
 still selling out every game despite showing little improvement
since gretzkys first year how do you explain people going
 see gretzky certainly arent going see winner havent
got winner theyve had much better teams past history than
 currently have yet didnt draw well 

i dont think accurate tickets sell people dont go 
 games i think thread has already been discussedseason ticket
holders la dont always use tickets so effect after kings
initial success following gretzkys arrival points same source
 corresponding attendance jump has been effective drop 
attendance even though ticket sales may have changed much 

whether kings winner debatable i claim since
gretzkys arrival have very least been competitivei also claim
 mcnall has made stupid move trying reassemble oiler
dynastybut thats another story included only because i dont like
mcnall anyway mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky 
 undoubtedly also responsible attendance merchandising
sales etc i said when kings have been little
tailspins over past couple years have been empty seats 
forum even tickets were sold

i think case lemieux gretzky player can transcend
winning major drawing power 

 short term imo although i think its inevitable team
 improve player lemieux gretzky simply because 
make people around them better

 winning sure hell helps 

well least we full agreement here

 does make rogers point any more valid jets arent

so you saying roger has ever had valid point couldnt resist

getting huge jump productivity yet getting huge
jump attendance due emergence teemu selanne
 have th best record hockey sure hell isnt because
 winning

yes doing worse than last year i think same type 
reasoning i applied new pittsburgh fan applies all extra people
showing up winnipeg games its difficult predict do you think
 jets miss playoffs next season year after 
 maintain attendance levels i seriously doubt because 
case expectation improving team would gone without
selanne

i did provide example rocket ismail toronto argonauts 
cfldid you leave out because you dont know much about cfl 
thats case fair enough isnt case im curious
 hear your explanation
