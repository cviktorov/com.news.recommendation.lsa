 ice can blamed himroger he forward winnipeg has 
lousy defensive record anyway lets put another way john cullens

count neither do selannes 

 object game feed selanne 
 win feeding selanne does contribute any meaningful way

feeding selanne so he can score does contribute meaningful way 
winning

wants again object exercise allow selanne
