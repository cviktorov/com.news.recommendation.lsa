well i gotta tell ya

last nights leafs game vs devils nailbitter let me tell you
 well played game both teams i thought according 
don ron offnight leafs devils 
were outplaying toronto well i beg differ

imho clark deserved first star much gilmour did his
fast breaks towards net good opportunites he
created reminded me clark old take any 
credit away from gilmour

i think leafs playing great hockey why 
well first look injury list which includes cullen ellet
zezel macoun course my question thishow leafs
