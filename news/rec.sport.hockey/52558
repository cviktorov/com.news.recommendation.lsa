tsn sportsdesk just reported ottawa sun has reported 
montreal send players million including vin damphousse
 brian bellows phillidelphia phillie send eric lindros
 ottawa ottawa give its first round pick montreal

 true most likely depend whether ottawa
gets choose st overall can ottawa afford lindros salary

personally i cant see philli giving up lindros anything
 didnt give away much quebec just trade him away
again mention lindros seems huge draw 
phillie he represents successful future 
franchise

ottawa may better off taking players from montreal
 pick
