 i think reason lemieux
had point season first nongretzky win hart 
ross since people turned out watch him play 

i grant star like mario draw fans even team sucks 
 short term only i still do think attendance increase 
 last unless team winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking
one pittsburgh still getting better so people continued support
them suddenly dropped say points youd have knee surgery
 some people jumping off bandwagon 

i disagree mcnall has demonstrated gretzky star brings out 
crowds whether team expected do well very few fans real
istically expect kings do well year although i do yet 
still go out see gretzky marketing strategy selling 
game selling stars employed baseball notably 
nba attitude new bettmanmcnall leadership 
bringing league have gone record stating 
trying sell game its stars timo salami brett hull perfect 
examples players real fans know arent worth damn yet being
benificiaries marketingoriented coaching strategies have goal totals
 would indicate casual observer very fans nhl wants 
attract players indeed superstars

 made transaction try build winner around mario 
true improvement attendance came before started doing
 coffey late before even had playoff bound team
 doubling attendance occured from previous year 
increase from points points going do arrival
 mario lemieux what did 

 might help think about what would go through fans mind who suddenly
found interest mario pens gee mario lemieux 
amazing ill go watch him play gee now weve got kick
ass guy our side ill go watch him play i think latter

 aint nearly so simple casual fan doesnt think about much 
 all can you actually find adult digit iq who believes 
mcdonalds makes good hamburgers
 
i did provide example rocket ismail toronto argonauts 
cfldid you leave out because you dont know much about cfl 
thats case fair enough isnt case im curious
 hear your explanation

yes apparently rocket has lived up his marketing responsi
bilities has he he hyped initially superstar outside 
one grey cup game he has done very little maintainenhance assess
ment his talents most argo fans probably feel team would better
off without him 

cordially always
