i thinking about who each teams were mvps biggest
surprises biggest disappointments year now just
my observations admittedly lacking because i have had 
opportunity see all teams same amount anyway
 
mvp most valuable player his team both terms points 
 terms leadership cant win without him
 
biggest surprise player who rose above expectation player
 may have raised level his game new height even
 new level doesnt necessarily warrant allstar berth
 includes those players who outset season may 
 even have been teams plans
 
biggest disappointment player from whom we expected more eg i
 picked denis savard montreal because new emphasis 
 offence brought demers shouldnt savard have done better
