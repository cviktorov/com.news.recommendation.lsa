thinking changing aluminum shaft so when i break blade all i 
have do change problem wide reange 
models selections out im certain which consider can
any you post some your suggestions experiences aluminum 
sticks what difference between models what do you likedislike about

ive had still have few aluminum sticks i got my first when i 
 christian broke shaft halfway through season two years 
later i bought another canadian beginning next season 
 i still have i also have easton friend getting rid 
off after giving up game i find easton blades easier get 
 all brands blades pretty well interchangeable watch out 
dried up bits firewood some stores pass off blades my 
experiences blades aluminum break more often than regular sticks
