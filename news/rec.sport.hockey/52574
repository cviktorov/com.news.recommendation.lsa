i thinking about who each teams were mvps biggest
surprises biggest disappointments year now just
my observations admittedly lacking because i have had 
opportunity see all teams same amount anyway
 
team mvp surprise disappointment

edmonton oilers manson buchberger mellanby

well since oilers didnt win heck lot games im sure
 deserve mvp cant win without him however id suggest kelly
buchberger instead dave manson who has had brutal year his pick 
 allstar game notwithstanding

 biggest surprise id say buchberger had higher expectations
 year due his breakthrough year him last year so he didnt
really raise his game my suggestion would shjon podein one 
callups from cape breton during year he quite far down 
depth chart oilers stable prospects made big impact 
 team he has goals his games only those decent
numbers thirdline player who seemingly doomed minorleague
oblivion oilers coaching staff likens his style john tonelli
i think hell fulltime roster next year

 biggest disappointment you could name any players oilers
dumped lousy production year nicholls gilchrist tikkanen 
even shayne corson mellanby isnt far off
