before i begin lambasting don cherry let me first say ive been sort 
 cherry fan whileadmittedly stuff he says has taken lightly
 hes moreorless harmless saturday however he crossed lines 
good taste

according don entire article wasnt perfect 
were some shots frank musil alpo suhonen 
don noted musil wasnt much player didnt
score many goals last year he also made fun names
one guy has name like dog food other like laxitive
metamusil

 best he can do gee don tremendous amounts professionalism
here cbc looks just bad he looks foolish letting him get away 
 nonsensemaking fun names its bad enough he makes asinine
blanket statements about european players hes now resorted making fun
 names too he sounded like idiot much like he did last week
when he said teemu would never make his rock em sock em video
until he dropped gloves

 subject realignment don said he liked 
new division names

well what he said even though hes been around league quite
some time he still doesnt know whos where wrt conference division
names hello mcfly names have been around couple decades
 sohe also invited audience name teams walesquick
quick followed ah you dont know i dont know 

sorry don wrong one

ron don i dont know wy i like you your show
 minutes i can hardly stand you show 

 absolutely hilarious

dons argument about basketball baseball brawls fairly
goodunfortunately he neglected mention fines were levelled 
 nba case serious moneyoh well hes never been one objectivity
has he

us change game your friends
