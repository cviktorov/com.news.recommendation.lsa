tsn sportsdesk just reported ottawa sun has reported 
montreal send players million including vin damphousse 
 brian bellows phillidelphia phillie send eric lindros
 ottawa ottawa give its first round pick montreal


obviously some reporter ottawa sun got taken april
fools jokeprobably started someone nordiques 
bruins 

like examplewho going reimburse flyers 
 million paid nordiqueslike senators 
going get lindros million flyers sent 
equivalent players when you include draft choices
 quebec going get only four back

some reporter had real badly someone must having 
real good laugh seeing how so much sports media
has chosen publicize utter nonsense

 true most likely depend whether ottawa
gets choose st overall can ottawa afford lindros salary


can you thinkit cannot possibly trueno need 

personally i cant see philli giving up lindros anything 
 didnt give away much quebec just trade him away 
again mention lindros seems huge draw 
phillie he represents successful future 
franchise
 
ottawa may better off taking players from montreal
 pick
 

i cant believe anyone would consider giving crap even
 remotest consideration
