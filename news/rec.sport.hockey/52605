 watching game between american canadian team lets say 
red wings canucks seeing names like bure konstantinov 
borshevshky north america isnt toronto detriot quebec
 edmonton particularly annoying numbers euros other
teams getting worse well

russian rocket i completely throw up now every time i see
 canucks play i keep hoping someone crosscheck bure plexiglassso hard have carry him out stretcher way im 
canucks fan begin 
 
 okay stretcher remark little carried away point 
i resent nhl owners drafting all europeans instead canadians 
some americans denies young canadians opportunity play 
north american league instead gives europeans who arent even
better hockey players its all hype european mystique sickening
 until nhl owners get over canadian american players continue
 have fight harder get drafted own league
 
 numbers euros nhl escalating problem clearly
only getting worse

 selannes world play own continent

 more french canadiens yeah theres idea let them french
speaking canadiens have own hockey league we dont want them
 you crazy nhl one true international
leagues yes many europeans who deserve play 
 nhl better than some north americans look teemu

people come together form soon hockey teams
