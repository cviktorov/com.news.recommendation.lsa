 smythe
 one toughest me call because i have put
personal bias aside go calgary i think lot depends who
wins division winnipeg move third end 
 season first place winner have clear advantage
 lot easier build momentum against team like 
kings whoever plays kings first round take 
division much hurts i have pick
division winner vancouver canucks

ill have disagree you one i think vancouver go 
bure goes he continues his goal scoring slump 
wont even make out first round i think kings make
 out first round regardless who play seem 
doing pretty well even bad game against minnesota 
saturday i think itll either calgary los angeles win 
smythe ie go conference finals 

wales conference trophy
islanders bruins fight end i think 
islanders have enough steam overtake bruins seven

campbell conference trophy
 walk vancouver maybe definately 

stanley cup final
islanders vancouver islanders have nothing left 
 point succumb fairly easily canucks

stanley cup champion vancouver canucks

still have disagree you here i think itll pittsburg 
get hat trick stanley cups just look
toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good 

i hope you have enjoyed my predictions i hope 
all correct go calgary

neither do i well may best team win all pittsburg thats
just my worth
