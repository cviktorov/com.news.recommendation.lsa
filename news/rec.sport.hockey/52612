 ten years ago number europeans nhl roughly quarter
 what now going season numbers euros 
 nhl teams have escalated following stats
 
 canadians 
 americans 
 europeans 
 
 please note numbers rounded off taken from top
 players each teams my source vancouver sun
 
 heres point far too many europeans nhl i am sick
 watching game between american canadian team lets say 
 red wings canucks seeing names like bure konstantinov 
 borshevshky north america isnt toronto detriot quebec
 edmonton particularly annoying numbers euros other
 teams getting worse well 

thats why we have expansion create more jobs nhl teams cant afford 
import role players from europe pick stars continue build
 teams around local players
 
 numbers euros nhl escalating problem clearly
 only getting worse
 
 im all creation european hockey league let bures
 selannes world play own continent

id love see european nhl division cant see happen some
time theres simply enough fan interest moment several
crucial markets like germany italy france while sweden finland
probably cant afford shell out tickets way
americancanadian fans do call minnesota north stars effect
scandinavians do love hockey we prefer watch local inexpensive
hockey nhl national hockey league should love idea though
paneuropean tv channels eurosport could bring millions 
american networks likely never pay
