 team biggest biggest
 team mvp surprise disappointment
 
 philadelphia flyers lindrosrecchi fedykgalley eklund
 
 fencesittinglook phillys record eric without
 doubt soderstrom probably biggest surprise

re eric true fortunately we didnt get find out what would 
like without recchi games

soderstrom absolutely shutouts games rookie without lot
 defense front him runnerups galley fedyk who scoring
 ton over career best galley thinks hes paul coffey puts scoring
ahead defending fedyk has tailed off big time

eklund big question mark year coming off injuries 
points games bad all recently hes been huge factor
 wins theyve gotten eklund has never had point game season 
his career his production very typical him how does he qualify 
 disappointment anything hes surprise

my choice would roussel i went strictly what expected players
 i never thought he had what takes goalie my biggest
disappointment bill dineen i thought he going perfect
coach young team instead hes made too many bad moves imho
has cost them enough games keep them out playoffs year any
coach thinks putting eric lindros point power plays 
bright idea needs go back coaching school
