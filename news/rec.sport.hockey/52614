game summary

 flyers played like every night theyd playoffs 
year flyers hit everything moved created scoring chance after
scoring chance snuffed out everything leafs tried do

jason bowen made good play his first nhl shift almost created goal
he had puck top left offensive circle all alone instead
 taking shot he found brindamour crashing net other side
 perfect pass good shot across daren puppas body should have been 
goal puppa made great save reading play

garry galley gave maple leafs th ranked power play first chance when
he hooked doug gilmour flyers lowly st ranked penalty killing
unit almost flawless entire game set tone kill 
maple leafs got almost nothing long unscreened shots defense swept
away every rebound

after power play flyers got goal ugly play rod brindamour
gave puck greg hawgood right point he sent drive 
net puppa made save kicked rebound right feet josef
beranek bob rouse who were wrestling slot beranek able 
get his stick puck push out dineen who skating 
 slot from right circle he lifted backhander over puppa 
 flyers lead 

 flyers kept pressure puppa only leaf keeping flyers
from building lead while eventually things settled down 
defense prevailed each team got occasional scoring chance goalies
were strong bowen started giving some lindroslike checks his own corners
 lindros who looking avenge hit foligno gave him thought he had
 chance even score he had foligno lined up center ice leaned 
him rode him center ice boards only problem foligno
 little far from boards mike mister mcgeough felt 
warranted boarding call 

 leafs couldnt get anything going power play flyers were
very aggressive change kill

 time running out period recchi carried through neutral zone
 handed lindros approached leafs blue line were 
 crowd wendell clark jamie macoun lindros tried backhand pass
 recchi through feet macoun connected recchi clark
checked recchi off puck macoun tried clear weak 
went right mcgill who had manned point he drove from just inside
 blue line macoun got his stick deflected past his own
goalie shots were flyers period

 flyers finally got first chance power play when dave andreychuk
tripped up rod brindamour his offensive zone during power play 
flyers got cheated little when puck popped up air eric
gloved down mcgeough thought hit his stick above his head we
could see from our seats other end ice only hit his glove
 replay confirmed faceoff went other end time 
running out advantage lindros found galley pass across goal
mouth puppa made save rebound kicked back right corner where
recchi picked up passed out eric crashing through right circle
 eric onetimed past puppa assist recchi moves past
bobby clarkes season second best one season total flyer 
 eric moves up th all time flyers rookie scoring points

mike eastwood took down al conroy give flyers another chance 
 power play much pressure before garry galley ended power play 
 slash much happened although leafs had most
 possession flyers smothered leafs short power play tempers
flared little bowen pearson got roughing minors keith acton
got bloody face dave mcllwain took dive got greg hawgood 
hooking minor set up replay showed hawgoods
stick stopped making contact mcllwain long before he spun around fell
again flyers smothered leafs power play led dimitri yushkevich
bowen made thundering hit when he came out box pearson berehowski
tried perplex everybody his sloooowball he had puck point
 just trickled pass down slot he made all flyers look silly 
nobody could get stick got gilmour side net
 soderstrom stoned him

 flyers picked things up offensively after kill over didnt
get anything home shots were flyers

 flyers were content goal lead third period 
decided tommy wanted shutout he going have work 
little

 flyers got most scoring chances first so minutes 
period couldnt get past puppa leafs got tired lindros making
road kill out them tempers flared each doug gilmour lindros 
unsportsmanlike conduct each glenn anderson mcgill roughing
all terry carkner took kneeing penalty gilmour

again flyers smothered leafs power play

 about minute mark dave andreychuk got shot away from his left
circle got through soderstrom puck rolling its side 
 luck would have turned away from net instead turning towards
 think how rolling quarter inevitably starts lean one way 
other seconds later rod brindamour tripped up gilmour give 
leafs another chance power play advantage after soderstrom
stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got rebound through
soderstrom from behind net went straight through swept
away one his defensemen kept pressure soderstrom 
equal preserved shutout

recchi cross checked ken baumgartner get tempers hot start brawl
 punches thrown recchi got initial minor krushelnyski
baumgartner lindros each got roughing minors rouse beranek
expressed mutual dislike each other got each slashing 
set up another mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill flyers
zone were battling puck while mcgill down he ran
his stick across mcgills face flyers were happy all
 al conroy paired up berehowski started throwing punches
upward well al held his own much delight crowd each got
 couple punches before going down head al got standing o
penalties eastwood cross check game clark carkner each berehowski
 conroy each fighting 

so major penalty rest game flyers had interest
 stting lead hawgood galley brindamour played catch until
hawgood found dineen all alone left circle he controlled puck 
blasted past puppa 

 all fireworks tommy soderstrom would face another shot puppa
did kept flyers off board flyers shots were flyers 
rd probably strongest game ive seen from flyers since all star
break shutout number soderstrom all since tied nd most 
 nhl hes played fewer games than belfour goalie i cant
remember hes tied 

next up its winnipeg selannes tuesday night winnipeg flyers cannot
 eliminated win loss coupled islander win night
 washington would official end

flyers up points season games last year had points
 games under so need least points last 
games improve only percentage points under better
than under 

tragic number holds points games left tragic number th
 points i watched rangers blow third period lead home 
lose before i finished up why points instead well flyers
 win tiebreaker catch them whereas islanders win tie
breakers against flyers so need only tie rangers could crumble
down stretch play devils pens twice flyers 
finish up games against caps so i guess th place could 
goal team focus
