implicitly you assuming goals scored against winnipeg selanne
 ice can blamed himroger he forward winnipeg has 
lousy defensive record anyway lets put another way john cullens 
 terrible whats your excuse him his powerplay points dont
count neither do selannes 
 
 you comparing cullen salami i would say valid 
 winnipeg lousy defensive team why hell does salami
 stand around other teams blueline when puck his own end

 i thought he comparing cullen teemu selnne i always thought
 salami some sort sausage you dear roger able 
 see salami ice playing hockey i dont know what do you
 surely should do something very quickly

 maybe you think you keep talking some rubbish after some time
 everybody consider really true you should take care 
 your leafs surely need more
 
 
what he does best scoreso i refer you my comment above
 
 some our finnish friends who have watched him play claim he
 can play solid twoway game i would have say style
 contribution would more conducive winning dont you 
 think so

 least we have seen him playing 
 
 now selanne
 grandstanding goal suck did you see way he parades around
 his arms outstretched after scoring goal you would think 
messiah had returned

 during latest philly game leaf players didnt parade philly
 crunched them maybe you need some more two way players who can
 score too
