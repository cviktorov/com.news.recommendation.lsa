 ten years ago number europeans nhl roughly quarter
 what now going season numbers euros 
nhl teams have escalated following stats

canadians 
americans 
europeans 

 please note numbers rounded off taken from top
 players each teams my source vancouver sun

 heres point far too many europeans nhl i am sick
 watching game between american canadian team lets say 
red wings canucks seeing names like bure konstantinov 
borshevshky north america isnt toronto detriot quebec
 edmonton particularly annoying numbers euros other
teams getting worse well 


from where i come from canada borshevsky sounds more canadian than
smith 

anyways crawl back hole you crawled out ofthe nba doesnt
care where get basketball players from major league baseball
doesnt give damn where get baseball players from except cuba
 

canada imminent danger being overtaken primary 
supplier playerssweden finland czech republic slovakia
 all relatively small countries cannot really produce players
 greater rate than already producing them 
potential influx from former soviet union severely blunted
because system has been raided starved finances 
 take decade two recover become real threat 
 us just maintain its slow increase canada should continue
 supply plus top hockey players world 
forseeable future

besides we need european hockey market hockey take
its rightful place besides soccer two predominant world
sportsand since soccer essentially boring unlike hockey

 i live vancouver i hear one more word about pavel bure 
russian rocket i completely throw up now every time i see
 canucks play i keep hoping someone crosscheck bure plexiglassso hard have carry him out stretcher way im 
canucks fan begin 

 okay stretcher remark little carried away point 
i resent nhl owners drafting all europeans instead canadians 
some americans denies young canadians opportunity play 
north american league instead gives europeans who arent even
better hockey players its all hype european mystique sickening
 until nhl owners get over canadian american players continue
 have fight harder get drafted own league

 numbers euros nhl escalating problem clearly
only getting worse


canadians under threatthe european numbers soon saturate
 havent alreadyand time russia comes online again
 nhl should world league many more teams
 stock many more jobs canadian hockey players near
team percentage canadians mostly decline because 
americans because europeans

 im all creation european hockey league let bures
 selannes world play own continent

 i just dont want them mine


crawl hole die
