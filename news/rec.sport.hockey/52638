 foul any illegal contact other player his stick your
 body stick you get you out game

ive never seen game where one player has committed 
penalties something like would require more attention 
 referee

 
 unsportsmanlike contact intentional foul inlcludes all 
 current flavours roughing fighting boarding you get two you
 thrown out game fined
 
 technical foul bad mouthing ref player coach penalty shot
 awarded two you thrown out game
 
 besides penalty shot one technical team gets penalties
 period opposing team gets penalty shot every additional one
 until end period victim gets two shots heshe 
 act shooting when foul ocured
 
 works well several reasons first penalty shots most
 exciting thing hockey right so follows more better
 next when player setting up penalty shot network can
 take commercial finally only three penalties network
 announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall 
 marv levy among others able tell viewers what happened before
 pa announcer says 
 

 youre creating scoring opportunity where might 
have been one before i can see relationship between free
throws awarded after certain number fouls its
obviously easier score basketball more
opportunities basketball team scores points thats
 least fifty chances made average number shots taken
 each team hockey game total guess 
probably around team lucky capitalize maybe
 them you have some good ideas concerning other
penalties i think player should awarded 
penalty shot only when had chance score 
interfered 

also later post you talked about how boring nba
game you attended play stopped too often
wouldnt your penalty shot rule take up more time during 
hockey game
