messier joke year bad back withstanding his play 
 reason rangers golf course couple weeks
gartner my choice guy works his butt off every game

kovalev surprise hes played adequately bad defensively

kovalev too talented player play roger nielsonroger needs
players who cant think themselves can only skate straight
lines up down ice dudley nielson only two coaches
bad enough league take talents like mogilny kovalev 
 know how turn them bure selanne

 predicted preseason perhaps hell pull alex mogilny 
 couple years surprise us zubov wasnt expected make
 out minors season owing number injuries
has proved very pleasant surprise


get muckler coach kovalev look like mogilny

 trouble rangers neil smith went out got
players like messier kovalev graves who have been schooled 
taking game opponent attacking while hiring coaches
who interested ropeadope strategies you want 
roger nielsons world your coach you dont go out 
get mark messier who old dog who cant learn new tricks
from known loser you dont waste your draft picks players
like kovalev
