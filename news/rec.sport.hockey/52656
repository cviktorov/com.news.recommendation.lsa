 heres point far too many europeans nhl i am sick
 watching game between american canadian team lets say 
red wings canucks seeing names like bure konstantinov 
borshevshky north america isnt toronto detriot quebec
 edmonton particularly annoying numbers euros other
teams getting worse well 

gee youd think winnipeg would tops list what regulars
being european



 i live vancouver i hear one more word about pavel bure 
russian rocket i completely throw up now every time i see
 canucks play i keep hoping someone crosscheck bure plexiglassso hard have carry him out stretcher way im 
canucks fan begin 

well being jet fan i sometimes wish bure would get knocked silly
too nothing serious just enough keep him out game 



 okay stretcher remark little carried away point 
i resent nhl owners drafting all europeans instead canadians 
some americans denies young canadians opportunity play 
north american league instead gives europeans who arent even
better hockey players its all hype european mystique sickening
 until nhl owners get over canadian american players continue
 have fight harder get drafted own league

 most cases owners have very little do give 
general managers one order when comes draftfind me best
players so our team win stanley cup whether player 
 kindersley saskatchewan chelyabinsk russia gm believes him
 better player gm should drafting him

where do you get off calling nhl league when referring canadian
players doesnt belong them belongs owners owners
can do what want while canadian content rule might enforcable
here canada enough doubt would enforcable us
 cfl sorry football reference didnt even try push 
import ratio rule sacromento goldminers

increasing competition elite positions most cases would
make players better anyways oh yeah how many europeans play 
lower levels professional hockey north america while some
 play ahl ihl where thats nhl teams primary farm
club you dont hear many europeans playing chl echl 
 secondary farm teams ihl ie jets do have few russian
players moncton i dont believe any europeans ft wayne
so all those teams plenty positions hockey players
 north america


 numbers euros nhl escalating problem clearly
only getting worse

 im all creation european hockey league let bures
 selannes world play own continent

 i just dont want them mine

im favour nhl being league premier players 
world ive grown up europeans playing my team some those
players were among best world from hedberg nilsson
