id love see european nhl division cant see happen some
time theres simply enough fan interest moment several
crucial markets like germany italy france while sweden finland
probably cant afford shell out tickets way
americancanadian fans do call minnesota north stars effect
scandinavians do love hockey we prefer watch local inexpensive
hockey nhl national hockey league should love idea though
paneuropean tv channels eurosport could bring millions 
american networks likely never pay

 brings up question i asked myself answer when mentionned
 nhl could expand europe

would most northamericans now playing nhl willing
 play team europe

i do think majority hockey players necessarily
interested expanding cultural experience level
i know i would i am pro hockey player

when one recalls some players remarks last few years makes
me wonder how european expansion could achieved remember 

 lindros did want play quebec more than reasons
 nicholls edmonton
 r courtnall wanted traded la only
 c lemieux said he would refuse go edmonton earlier year

i know many noncultural reasons behind more

 some american players who played expos complained about french
 fact city quite like other us cities one
 players wife trying make her point went complain she could
 even find her favorite brand nacho chips montreal

anybody knows what happened when all us football players moved
 london spain etc one year new football league
 years ago

i wonder what players association thinks about going europe

myself i would like see some european teams what would 
 best way do
