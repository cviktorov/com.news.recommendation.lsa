well patrick division got little more interesting last night 
 islanders lost ot devils tied pens means isles
beat devils friday meet caps playoffs

however i have some more comments islanders hockey 
general i need get off my chest first all islanders 
backtoback lackluster performances against whalers one may think 
 islanders out shape guys always suck wind nd period
come little rd run out gas too soon unbelieveable
how many one goal games guys have lost anyway games pretty 
wide open isles still have tons trouble scoring whalers played 
 golie st nhl start i think his name lenarduzzi sp his nhl 
debut tuesday tie against isles like i mentioned before 
guy looked like best golie planet while until he misplayed 
mahlakov slap shot go ot i say its because isles dont shoot 
correctly has anyone else noticed 

also i think really shame hockey when i guy like mick
vukota gets much ice time he does guy has about much hockey
talent jiggs macdonald who did play hockey i think anytime he gets 
puck gets stolen he always starts fights gets needless penalties 
richard pilon another guy who ice stir up crap hes 
defenseman hes got approaching negative infinity his plusminus 
 guy gets beaten all time why need enforcers 
only do fights slow game down alot takes away from guys who 
really trying play game ill one few admit i do enjoy 
good fight once while only when its called you know when 
guy checks goalie too hard other words violation hockey ethics
might cause you get puched need start crap when you 
losing becuase you can get away does anyone agree referees
need little less lenient rd ot i mean come already 
im sick seeing teams pulling guys down holding guys etc just becuase 
referee doesnt call ot late rd should time strategy
 physical prowess trying set up goal should first foremost 
 you so afraid other team going score you have 
pull guy down prevent you dont deserve win first place

just my honest opinion
