he already offered million them from northlands coliseum
 refused offer i dont think he going sale i think he
may decide move team states though where he can draw
more revenue from team


pocklington just wanted wake up powers holding political
office northlands business community oilers
 current lease arrangement state where yearly
basis likely have operating loss based normal hockey
revenues expenses he did good thingit better
he complain early make city aware potential looming crisis
before he begins lose millions millions dollarswhich would
truly jeopardize franchise

pocklingtons first option sell move sell
 minority share team realize some appreciated value
 team get better arena deal either northlands 
via new building pocklington probably isnt going get exactly
what he wantsbut ultimately he probably get enough 
sell someone who probably get enough

 lot risks moving team also

one has remember peter pucks principleit better 
spend other peoples money than ones own all possible
