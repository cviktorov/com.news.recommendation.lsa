 what makes you think so id like understand your reasoning
 from my seat caps dont really appear believe can 
 defeat pittsburgh therefore dont i think spirit 
 broken last years playoffs hasnt really recovered i dont know 
 what season series numbers were i believe pens won 
 i think either devils islanders cause more problems 
 
 
 what spirit crap im caps fan hope win
 end up facing pittsburgh
 i dont think caps lose pitt because lack
 spirit yes penguins won season series against 
 caps theyve won eighteen games row gods sake
 did you ever think penguins might good thats
 why win

i reread what i wrote didnt say exactly what i thought 

sure pens better team theyve got size best skill players
 league theyve also got best clutch goaltending theyre 
best team league

 my point caps have played ability level vs 
pens since last years choke thats mental problem one theyve
had number years i tried point out spirit mental preparedness
 win whatever you want call its missing when caps play 
pens actually youre right wont make any difference
