 win over tough whaler squad leafs showed all doubters
what playoff hockey all about 
 

so roger what exactly playoff hockey all about convenient
phrase use certain circumstances only

you see when you spout off flame bait too many times sooner later
 catches up you

nice try deepak tough whaler squad should have clued you 
fact my leaf woofing tongueincheek

 playoff hockey any more intense than regular season variety 
 because teams facing each other least consecutive times
 days hockey being contact sport some things 
 carried over might dissipate during regular season 
only some players many rest who have been playing 
injuries who miss families who like grant fuhr would really
rather playing golf dont really give damn course i cant say 
 sure i believe fairly typical human nature i
dont think hockey players above having what i consider typically
human attitudes 

 recent salary escalations key players actually losing 
money participating playoffs ones who regard playoff
take some kind bonanza fringe players who unlikely
 consistently force playoffs now i know some you 
going come back winning spirit all crap 
players professionals after all while may love play 
game love entirely incidental purpose which make
 decent living 

 course coach professional well part what he 
being paid do motivate players so coach does his
job well enough players may respond winning effort

 second season after all merely exhibition true champions
 league division winners teams come out top 
after long struggle season stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory team has remained healthy hot 
emphasis playoffs sudden death appeal has been promoted
 media owners profit purely mind even pittsburgh
loses playoffs we all know were really best team 
league over year proved 

cordially always
