 selke candidate forwards main purpose shift prevent goals
from being scored score them when lemieux gilmour play 
number one purpose score defence secondary especially considering
 line plays against them probably defensive one 
why selke candidates
gainey best defensive forward ever i stand assessment
he very good player who belongs hall fame did you
ever watch him play he never made technical error

i watched him over his entire career i have never seen player 
includes russell courtnall davie keon screw up many breakaways 
bob gainey i never forget time denis potvin caught gainey
 his head down you have been sold bill goods bob gainey

 stars dynasties start hype pluggers grant fuhr essa
tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek
sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri
richard dick duffand so
