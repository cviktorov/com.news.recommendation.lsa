 game two problems course you would want

 avoid all costs delaying people leave building 
 instance goodies given people exit
 
 i went new jersey devilscarvel ice cream puck night tm last year 
 see beloved bruins play pucks were given out end game
 i could just imagine what would have happened late third bruins
 were winning
 
 figures after i posted first article i found out whalers 
 going using coupons giveaway friday night i believe 
 some big corporation probably bank flying disk night i think
 we could all see potential danger here
 
 all all i have seen whole bunch giveaways land ice 
 never ceases amuse me im just thankful players one has
 yet sponsor lead pipe night any arenas
 
 thats probably because couldnt find anyone sponser maybe uss
