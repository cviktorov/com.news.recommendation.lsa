 first hartford goal gord hynes misplayed puck flyers blue
line nylander stripped him took off

 recchi goal lindros

 bowen goal just puck he threw net got good carom 
ended up behind goalie

 second nylander goal he got three whacks puck before went 
 most frustrating part flyers defense take body 
 get one shot beat you fine dont give them another chance carkner
galley mcgill all terrible about ill bet money least one 
them closest flyer play

thats all i have my radio got bad after i lucky know who 
 scored much less how

from what i heard roussel had very strong game after game gene hart
asked bobby taylor pick three stars season rather than 
game garry galley his career high point total im surprised
 former goalie wouldnt look closer his defensive play tommy 
soderstrom his team record tying shutouts only about season
 mark recchi his all time high team single season scoring mark
 heres odd part he couldnt decide between lindros recchi 
number he picks recchi after he had hard time choosing between
him lindros doesnt make lindros 

what you wanna know my three stars season well since you asked

 eric lindros eric dominates game simply stepping out onto ice
 difference between teams record him without him 
accident i believe team could have been almost successful without
recchi question team significantly better eric
lindros i think he deservedly wear c his jersey
next season

 tommy soderstrom shutouts second league only ed belfour
 tommy didnt have chris chelios booo front him he also didnt
play complete season due heart problems sentimental edge here my family
has history heart problems theres question my mind tommy
soderstrom teams goalie future roussel complains again
about being number look him traded within years

 mark recchi again you cant argue alltime team high single season
scoring mark awful lot teams didnt have single player
get many points plus mark only flyer play entire season
 tough choice

honorable mentions rod brindamour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year difference he wasnt top line
 year didnt get much playing time again he didnt get 
defensive attention he got last year from other team either

dimtri yushkevich teams most consistent defenseman yes he made rookie
mistakes he usually fast enough make up them i have feeling
 his shot hell score few more points next year without giving up
anything his own zone i suspect hell teams top defenseman
 years come

garry galley teams point leader from defensemen again some
things you just cant argue he battled chronic fatigue syndrome
he certainly deserves kudos only missing one game against his
wishes under doctors orders his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution little more caution little bit smarter his own end
 make him much more important part team next year

brent fedyk leagues biggest improvement over last years point total
 consistency became problem him

 couple misc notes mostly mailing list members
