did anyone else see game last night just like playoff game
lots hittingbut i disappointed video goal judge
 all replays joe murphys goal shouldnt have counted didnt go net
 according tsn broadcasters video goal judge said he
saw water bottle top cage move so he assumed puck went 
 terriblehope crap like doesnt occur playoffs
 game would have ended tie 

i thought red light went onthus review presumption
would find conclusive evidence puck did go 
netfrom replays i say even from rear evidence wasnt
conclusive puck outin my opinion

 seemed pretty conclusive me puck clearly hit crossbar
 came down line announcers admittedly homers
kept harping about how must have had different view upstairs
because obvious them i would have thought anyone who
saw replay puck didnt go referee originally 
signalled goal video replay judges initiated contact 
 referee claim goal fact scored me 
unheard seeing stuff like happen gives me bad feeling about
 leaf chances year

cordially always
