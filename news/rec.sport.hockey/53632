i can live other changes have been made eg playoff format
change change division conference names really annoys me
batman tsn last night saying changing names would make 
game easier occasional fan follow he should have said what he
meant changing names make game easier americans 
nonhockey cities follow i dont know too many my friends who had 
 hard time following which teams were each division even minimal amount
 exposure game allows person quickly pick up 

 nothing wrong making game easier americans 
follow more fans merrier even you dislike occasional
fan always chance fans become fanatics

i am glad names being changed another reason names
patrick smythe norris adams campbell all names socalled
builders game same type thinking put stein
 hall fame absolute nonsense real builders 
game richard morenz howe conacher orr etc you going 
name divisions after people least name divisions after people
who deserve 

i think you incorrect roger patrick
smythe adams all played coached league before becoming
front office types hence did help build league although
 were great players themselves 

i agree name name name some people
have trouble names easily processed fans
 changing them names more easily processed seems like
 reasonable idea we can get people arena door being
uncomplicated lets do so once we have them realize
what great game hockey we can teach them something
abotu history game 
 
 history names can put rather succinctly all aforemen
tioned used game hockey make money can you imagine pocklington
division ballard division how about green division

 i would want see ballard division say
 owners assholes hence all nhl management people 
assholes would fallacious conn smythe example classy
individual from what i have heard 

also isnt point professional hockey make money
 all those involved which would include players what i think
you might saying players have made much money 
should have been due players what make
 game great people who put them ice so naming
division after management people rather than players adding insult
 form lesser recognition injury less money than 
deserved
