 what kills me
 stanley cup finals 
 
 toronto maple leafs vs montreal canadiens 
 classic stanley cup final matchup also dream come true
 
 montreal wins stanley cup th game double overtime
 roy potvin spectacular throughout series share series mvp 
 possible vincent damphouse nets game winner from brilliant pass 
 brian bellows canadiens star denis savard watched his buddies play from 
 owners box nursing splinter his thumb which has left him 
 disabled list since first game playoffs awww shucks
