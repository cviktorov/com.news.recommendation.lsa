different record man i thought people net good hockey

golly i love stupid people 
listen rex hockey nhl precise nhl
 exist things called ties tie occurs when game ends
 score each team equal each team gets one point tie 
 also exits things called wins win when one team has 
higher score than opponent oh yeah only two teams play each other
 time so i can say opponent team gets two points 
win so lets say team has record wins losses 
ties another team has record wins losses ties 
first team has points second team has 
points wow both have same number points number
 wins different how did do thats amazing so
rex when people talk about wins being first tiebreaker well 
thats what means our example second team would win 
tiebreaker therefore have better record even though both teams
had same number points you didnt understand post rex
maybe you should go back read again very slowly
