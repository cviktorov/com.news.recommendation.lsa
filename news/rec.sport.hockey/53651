subject suggests flames were impressive afternoon
dropping decision la kings most flames neglected
 show up especially own zone kings hit least
five posts flames best line probably
skrudlandpaslawskiberube which tells how bad flames were gary
suter scored great goal fact all three flame goals were scored
 dmen yawney dahlquist getting others also made
some bonehead plays kings pat conacher especially
impressive 

 games very chippy dan mirouelli lost control early 
never recovered were highsticks crosschecks punches
hits from behind fleury got game misconduct rubbing out warren
rychel from behind flames dominated game physically failed
 take advantage due horrendous defensive lapses i dont think
vernon can blamed any goals calgary went dmen
 roger johansson played lw he looked lost imho i hope king
inserts chris lindbergh paul kruse sergei makarov wednesdays
game gretzky left game nd period charleyhorse 
idea how serious he didnt return

i still think flames should win series better
buckle down
