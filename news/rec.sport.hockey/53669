 bri i have tried tell you since february michael oneill
 might most underrated goalie ahl he isnt 
 ahl hes winnipeg jets injury list he has been since
 his first nhl start against ottawa senators hes out until
 next year after surgery repair shoulder separation

 stu barnes might ahl gun hawks hes now third
 line center jets has been since mid january so

sorry my memory gone i thought oneill got sent back

 says all about moncton because barnes still one 
 top so scorers even though hes been out since january
