everyone keeps talking about european expansion thinking
wishful thoughts being totally off ball

 league format we use here incompatible europe
 those dont know best teams from lower divisions get
promoted worst get demoted

would european fans put up our youve paid you can play 
attitude

how long would support teams run rangerbased 
corporate thinking i use term lightly we dont need good
product because duffuses nyc would fill arena ottawas
record every year haha sorry had ta say 

 hockey other pro sports had similar system europe maybe
teams like rangers would forced compete get demoted fourth 
division wed have many more teamscentres arent big like
halifax adirondackok so halifax isnt good example would 
eventually get promoted every team would somewhat competetive within
its own division unlike ottawa sj edmonton etc fans would eventually
get rewarded loyalty penalized neglect 
league would more interesting dynamic every year because influx
 newly promoted teams halifax citadels win stanley cupi can
dream cant i

look british any european soccer example never have fan
problems

just someone who thinks our system really sucks
