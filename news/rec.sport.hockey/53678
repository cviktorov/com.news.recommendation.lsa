 so roussel giving up almost another goal game while facing proportional
 number shots number minutes he played while i havet
 actually checked i believe he faced lower quality opponent
 
 make less than half goal game lower quality opponet
 argument immaterial neither roussel nor soderstrom had any say 
 matter dineens decision

so other words roussel shuts out sharks soderstrom shuts out
 penguins thats immaterial because coaches decision come 
joe think about what youre saying who played very significant
why played them whats irrelevent low gaa against good teams
 better than low gaa against bad teams context comparing two
goaltenders low gaa better higher gaa low gaa against good
teams much much better than higher gaa against bad teams context
 comparing two goaltenders

 fact matter despite last nights shutout he doesnt
 have what takes last night due inept ranger team much more
 than roussels skill dont get shot away none
 one guy just passes stops other guy shoots roussels pad
 
 cmon pete so rangers were inept shutout shutout during
 both soderstroms masterpieces against toronto mike emerich quoted
 saying he didnt think leafs had much offensive firepower past 
 first line does make soderstroms shutouts less impressive because 
 torontos lack offense

yes does absolutely context comparing two goaltenders
 course end season points points matter how you
get them score sheets shutouts shutouts youre 
coach deciding between two goalies gm looking make trade you
have got look deeper than stat sheets i didnt see second toronto
game first one defensive masterpiece nothing 
 game judge tommy soderstrom because he wasnt tested same
 roussel ranger game two real scoring chances one he made 
great play other he saved mistake from other player 
you were judging roussel game alone you have very little go 

 you were look tie against habs you saw goalie
stand his head get shutout goalie action roussel
doesnt have game like him

 well you look back november when roussel goalie soderstrom
 being treated his heart ailment flyers finished november 
 were overall theres way knowing where flyers
 would have finished soderstom wasnt wearing oragne n black im glad
 we dont have find out anytime soon either because he one hell 
 player i would take him over roussel right now i still think dom has
 what takes guy he outperformed hextall enough during 
 season make flyers management think way too

dont so sure flyers management never says bad thing about
roussel dont say too much good side either ive seen
 least two interviews where every time farwell asked how happy he 
 have two good goaltenders tommy tommy oh yeah
dom has played well too

 way what final card monday night team picture any
 chance

flyers nhl hall fame kinda dull really handed out 
team picture everybody who walked from pizza hut 
same picture sold programs midseason had names like benning
kasper

 how did flyers choose fans who received shirts off our
 backs winning recchis jersey after breaking clubs single season
 point record would have been nice knowing your luck you would have
 won roussels

mostly random seat locations some were given out having certain
autographs team photos i dont like method since ive seen
guards help out people get things like lindros pictures surely 
got hands autographed picture theyd hold em buddies
