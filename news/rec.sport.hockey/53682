 chelios norris

 you asked me days ago id agree you i now give nod 
raymond bourque his play took off same time bs did chelios
gets close second

how about kevin hatcher scored roughly goals plays minutes game

 dunno who wins vezina i suspect potvin 
 
barrasso finally gets his due close one over eddie eagle

thats really sad when two secondrate goalies barasso belfour
 main contenders vezina call me crazy how about
tommy soderstrom five shutouts th place team doesnt
really play defense its really unfortunate better goalies
 league mclean essensa vernon had unspectacular years btw
 you going award norris basis last days
why give vezina moog he has been best goalie over 
past month

 coach year tricky burns did most least raw talent
 king did good job flames clearly underachieved last year brian
 sutter has done exceptionally well his first year new team ditto
 demers page has been blessed ripening acquisition young
 talent darryl sutter having good year rookie coach berry made
 best bad situation terry crisp worked minor miracles bowman
 bowman id pick burns im mildly biased

 your case bias acceptable mine shows norris pick
so were even

im impressed what all coaches you mentioned did my pick would 
al arbour too many folks thought isles would playoffs let 
alone contend rd division granted did have little
help from cousins broadway 

 i like islanders about much i like mowing my lawn

arbour king burns probably win since playoffs arent taken
 consideration hes ok regular season im sure
 hes beaten anyone other than hartford playoffs
