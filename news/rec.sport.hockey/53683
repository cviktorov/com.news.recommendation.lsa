 bad news patrick division next year caps gm david polie 
 reportedly trying get front office job nhl i cant
 believe polie has been fired despite years mediocrity
 

you know what frank its david poiles fault caps
have mired mediocrity so long blame owner abe polin
 guy owns both nbas bullets nhls capitals how dumb
 selfish could guy hes unwilling spend bucks 
order get big star landoverno wonder both teams stink

ive heard capitals had chance get detroits
steve yzerman last summer pulled out last minute why
because our good man abe afraid spend cash

nevertheless im still faithful hoping one day
 devilish dictator replaced
