well tentative rules anyway course since season 
 entirely over tentative entry form who cares real hockey
season starting

heres deal you email preferably post your predictions 
number games you think each series go each round 
weighted so stanley cup finals very important 
early rounds still important here scoring

pick st round winner way off games points
pick st round winner within one game points
pick st round winner pick games points

pick nd round winner way off games points
pick nd round winner within one game points
pick nd round winner pick games points

pick conference champ way off games points
pick conference champ within one game points
pick conference champ pick games points

pick stanley cup champ way off games points
pick stanley cup champ within one game points
pick stanley cup champ pick games points
pick loser series goes points
pick loser series decided game ot points
 last two sympathy points probably wont happen anyway

obviously picking stanley cup champion important i do some
tests see format fair probably i too lazy 
modify so scoring probably like entry forms
