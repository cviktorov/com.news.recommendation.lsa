 bryan trottier denis potvin vicious
boarding from behindtrottier given major
 
perhaps trottier happened behind habs goal 
i recall gainey simply didnt have his head up he 
picking up puck
 
 roger what hell does have do gaineys
skill hockey player probert smashes gilmours head
 boards next week diminish your assessment
 gilmours skills
 
 gilmour taken completely surprise gainey 
yeah i would have say doug wasnt playing
technically smart hockey any case claim greg did
 gainey never made technical mistake absolutely
ludicrous
 
later your posting you make reference putting words
 other peoples mouthsi would suggest your last
paragraph can only interpreted one waynamely i
along greg claim gainey never made technical
mistake you actually read what ive written you find
 i make claimsoooo logic serves me well
youre contradicting yourself
 
gainey plugger when press runs out things
 say about stars dynasties start hype 
pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob
nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne
cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri
richard dick duffand so 
 
i would take fuhr sanderson off latter
 
good you youd only displaying your ignorance 
course each his own
 
roger im sure here i think ignorance really 
function lack knowledge formulating 
opinionbut hey you need take cheap shot all
means go aheadthats makes you feel better
 
i think gainey would honoured know youve included
him
 
i think gainey should feel honoured know he 
remembered all
 
 
my word vehemence against poor ol bob gainey why does
he bother you so muchhe effective player his style
 play
 
 list i also think you have relatively naive view
about what wins hockey gamepluggers integral part

 
certainly pluggers integral part any team 
 simply because enough solid twoway players 
go around who would you rather have your checking
centre doug gilmour doug jarvis matter i would
take either gretzky mario my checking centres do you
think gretzky could cover bob gainey 
 
im really sorry roger you have lost me completely here 
why dont you ask me i would rather have jesus christ
himself nets
 
now you were compare say example bob gainey guy
carbonneau you would have balanced comparison
 
any team selke designed acknowledge 
contributioni think most people understand its
 nobel prizeso settle down
 
youre wrong again selke awarded forward 
does best job defensively may may 
best plugger gilmour does best defensive job 
league i dont see why he should out running simply
because he also contributes offensively
 
im wrong againhmmm lets seewhere i wrong 
first place im only guessing here rog i have feeling
 youve setup youre wrong again macro key your
machine
 
i agree my use word plugger simplisticbut i
think you know what im getting i would also like point
out gilmours potential selkewinner never part 
 debateare you asking me opinion so i think
 far too many other deserving players include gilmour
among candidates
 
settle down you think i have likened selke 
nobel prize i suggest you had best settle down 
 you going try put words my mouth let me
suggest you settle down before you bother following up
 my postings 
 
i would suggest your comment when press runs out
 things say about stars dynasties start hype
 pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob
nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman
bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick
duffand so demonstrates blanket disregard 
individuals contributors gameso yes settle
downnobody has claimed hockey gods
 
congenially always
