sharks season came close tonight i start series posts
trying revisit players trades moves etc went through
 sharks past season you uninterested since i 
have words sharks review subject heading postings you can
kill them

i first try evaluate how players did ratings course
 subject my own biases i hope i can try objective 
possible i evalute players who finished season sharks
andor did play another nhl team season

thus lets go goaltenders

brian haywardseasonth
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradep d

 sad his career has come dim end career 
featured sharing three jennings trophies patrick roy 
 would indeed unfair me do anything give him passing
grade skip letter grading he had simply been awful ice 
year save bright spot two even he had been healthy he would
 any more than rdstring goalie

 hayward classy individual who also figured sharks first
ever victory rd game season last year against calgary flames
 he retires fans remember what good guy he 

jeff hackettseason rd
acquired from n y islanders expansion draft
gradec

hackett after deservedly winning team mvp honors last season simply
wasted year other than few good spots saves against los angeles
almostshutout against tampa bay etc hackett finishing save
percentage gaa watched his status go from teams goalie 
bench decoration end season he expected early carry
 team along instead he apparently became frustrated early
injury forced him miss games may have been contributing factor
 upon return he simply wasnt up task he may return next
year

wade flahertyseason st still eligible rookie
acquired signed undrafted free agent
gradei 

 pretty hard evaluate goaltender just one game alone thus 
incomplete grade yet one start he did get against calgary
flames flaherty nothing sharp least two periods he started
 season poorly kansas city finished strong prompting blades
owner ron parker comment he should candidate ihl mvp
honors upcoming ihl playoffs would major challenge him he
tries make nhl last year he capable backup arturs
irbe throughout season turner cup playoffs picking up
allstar honors along irbe now its time him show he can
share job irbe next year because prospects dan ryder trevor
robins scott cashman coming along he doesnt make next year he
may ever

arturs irbeseasonst
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradeb

i may yet overly critical irbe year he clearly established 
hes bona fide nhl goaltender perhaps bona fide goaltender he has
provided most little highlight footage sharks team had getting
 teams first ever shutout against los angeles kings december 
he has been fearless out net aggressively playing puck 
making passes reminding people young ron hextall except course 
goonism yet he still needs develop more consistency which hard do
 bad defense front him sharks challenge 
 playoff spot next season irbes key he demonstrated being named
 star game times starts


go calgary flames al macinnis norris gary roberts hart smythe
go edmonton oilers go playoffs next year stay edmonton
