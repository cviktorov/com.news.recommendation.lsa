 all all decent game where defense wasnt best
 both teams juggled around lines bit second third period
 try combinations

 renberg rundqvist plays well together swedish team larsson
 nilssonjuhlin best line overall again seems working wc line
 stillman good defense
 some players arent good enough wc though hakan ahlund faell ner
 hjaelmen och jobba roger hansson challe berglund kenny jonsson
 likely have leave nhl pros

 twogoal scorers jari korpisalo keijo sailynoja played well 
 finnish team markus ketterer didnt have very good game weve seen him
 lot better so lindfors probably finlands starting goalie wc
 i heard esa tikkanen join finnish team would inter
 resting know which other pros coach matikainen counts wc
