 after reading some reports possible nhl moves milwaukee 
 milwaukee should have nhl team i thought id pass along story i heard
 recently second hand so i dont know how true i have
 reason doubt either
 
 bradley center milwaukee home milwaukee admirals minor leauge
 hockey team owner admirals sorry i cant remember his name
 either owns least shelled out majority funds build 
 bradley center

lloyd pettit

 
 supposedly he approached nhl about expansion franchise 
 turned down because he thought franchise fee million too
 high
 
 like i said i dont know whether story true just rumor 
 its true dont look nhl team milwaukee anytime soon admirals
 arent going forced out building you wont see nhl club
 minor league club same building especially since nbas
 milwaukee bucks play well

yes true he refused buy franchise from nhl m 
 time reason established market teams much 
less than he felt one would pay m expansion team 
 he would simply wait buy existing franchise less than 
 market fooled him teams have been created m apiece 
last three years even existing teams cant moved less than 
m i doubt he could get one little

pettit gambled lost now hell have pay more
