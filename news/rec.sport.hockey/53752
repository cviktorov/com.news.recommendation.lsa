sorry disappoint you red wings earned victoryeasily

i watched most game espn soon i realized 
were televising game which beginning second
 maple leafs were flat very flat meanwhile red wings were
skating very freely dictating pace game i didnt
detect any bad penalty calls van hellemond did his usual good job
toronto looked like how i expected them first playoff
game few years nervous

 leafs sake i hope can rid themselves butterflies
 game game indicative series its gonna go
quick
