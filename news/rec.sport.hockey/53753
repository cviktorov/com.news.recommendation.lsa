you obviously dont understand how tv scheduling works espn had
prior contracts baseball show monday night games had
contracted all other bs shows well advance nhl tv deal
 very late scheduling process you normally have do 
oneplus year out nhl package finished two weeks before 
season started espn has shown tremendous commitment nhl 
squeezing extra telecasts when could like last minnesota
game putting stanley cup games backup baseball
telecasts which favorable circumstances could pull off last
night

 bottom line espn cannot break contracts 
must honor previous deals made does have something
 do especially you risk lawsuit breach 
contract baseball

so relax im happy i dont get sportschannel anyway
