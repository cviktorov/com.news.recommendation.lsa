 predicting although i think bryan murray probably best gm
i have ever seen hockey
 
how do you figure when bryan murray took over wings were
 pretty good team contending stanley cup looked
unlikely win now pretty good team contending 
 stanley cup looks unlikely win truly great gm would
have been able make moves push team upper echelon
 nhl maybe win stanley cup good gm like murray can

i think murray has done great job hes picked up ciccarelli
sheppard ysebaert howe coffey riendeau plus some depth players 
without giving up anything wings needed any his top prospects
all three years has anyone done better

 year before he took over wings didnt even make playoffs
 about year half during demers stint wings
did ok due demers motavational skills clutch
 grab style didnt have much talent

gerald murray wasnt responsible primeau although im 
ready admit thats horrible pick hired him after 
draft which has never made sense me his first pick 
lapointe

ron 


 one my major goals leave next president new set
 things worry about im getting bored reading same problems
 paper decade after decade i want people have deal
 new problems
 president bill clinton
