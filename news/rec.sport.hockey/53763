 award best backup behind hockey great
underneath all hype about lemieux stevens jagr ulf
etc ron francis has quietly put together point season
 goals assists games probably 
best acquisition penguins have made since getting lemieux
apologies rick tocchet who has had hell year
himself pens got just right person just right
time when got francis before playoffs two years ago 
backup mario who secondline center before got
francis i remember randy gilhen who really plays tough 
ace faceoff circle nobody all skills
francis has scoring passing winning faceoffs putting
 every game every night just wanted glow 
little

i know what you mean i glow everytime ronnies out ice
 fact one neatest things about seeing pens person
 i can key him instead watching what id probably
 seeing tv he does so many subtle things behind play

he said interview recently when he kid his dad
stressed importance playing twoway hockey you have 
learn how play defense well offense he obviously took
 advice heart he breath fresh air when he arrived
 pittsburgh team whose forwards most part couldnt
 wouldnt play lick defense

its really difficult assess what key trades were brought
all success pens you mention rick tocchet he has
certainly helped even ol kjell has been steady looking 
 team you could almost take any one them out lineup
permanently replace them extremely mediocre player 
wouldnt matter

 i had pick top three acquisitions recent years would
 tom barrasso ron francis larry murphy id love put
francis first i do think only thing could really damage
 pens right now would lose barrasso
