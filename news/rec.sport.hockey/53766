paul stewart worst most biased ref presently nhl
he called total penalties habs one nordiques
 nords penalty came ot stewart being exnordique himself
 looking call penalties habs while letting nords
get away murderwe robbed

 patrick roy reason game lost ron hextall 
reason quebec won everybody said would come down goaltending 
goaltending key etc etc well key doesnt quite fit youre
montreal dionne penalty kind cheesy call lets face 
he literally left his feet throw elbow blaming stewart just 
excuse avoid facing fact roy allowed what one worst
goals he could possibly allow he even saw whole shot dammit besides
stewart evened things up bit calling quebec penalty ot

montreal played solid game although still dont know how clear
traffic front net loss schneider hurt even more 
normally i would say any team blows goal lead less than 
five let alone two minutes go regulation time playoff game 
especially needs smacked upside collective heads i dont
think team loss although keane should have been able clear 
 zone just prior first quebec goal roy paid big money 
play he looked like player industrial league sakics shot

demers should start racicot next game he should let
 damn team read papers next day twoand maybe 
article possible

patrick roy collapsed after letting tieing goal he shaky 
 his knees rest night winning goal shouldnt have
gone 

i didnt think wraparound bad second goal i also didnt
think scott young should have gotten around defender cant remember who
 first place you correct shouldnt have gone 
regardless

oh well least bruins lost ot also ha ha

yep moog looked bad mogilnys goal five seconds left second
imo how about neely though holy shit what player

speaking great players manohman can quebec skate i havent seen 
team so potent rush long time watching them break out 
zone especially sundin treat watch remind me red 
army 

 i still hate team

 rest games didnt st louis winning goal come 
powerplay penalties cost chicago dearly especially against detroit 
same goes calgary very very undisciplined when marty mcsorely 
waving guys bench avoid fights you know somethings up new
jersey overmatched terreris heroics notwithstanding mario 
unbelievable jagr some reason shows up playoffs i 
hate team anyway
