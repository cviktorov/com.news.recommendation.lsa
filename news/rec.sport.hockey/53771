 detroit red wings put lot doubter ice tonight 
washing toronto maple leafs all you toronto fans have now seen 
power mighty red wing offense torontos defense match 
wing offense defense probert kennedey primeau came out
hitting hard toronto players were being thrown left right even
wendell clark tough enough wings tough guys wings only gave
up three goals low total what say mediocre defense
 all you leaf fans better speak up now you team probable have its
season ended soon wings fans keep up support

theres quite few wings fans lurking about here just tend
 low key thoughtful rather than woofers i suppose every
family must have roger clinton though remember paraphrase
one my favorite star trek lines we adopt ways leaf
fans we bad leaf fans
