bryan murray has done very little gmyzerman fedorov cheveldae
chaisson whole russian strategy product previous
gmmurray has made couple decent tradesthats about 
 would hardly rank him best gm

wasnt primeau murrays first decision gm

gerald

 many teams nhl who have taken liking russian players
 whole russian strategy specific detroit devellano
who gm before murray what previous gm also did trade 
away several players who have gone do well other teams most
notably my memory murray craven who had few very good years 
philly after leaving here also its volume trades 
necessarily improve team quality them trading adam oates
 bernie federko just plain stupid even federko used 
great player one time most murrays trades have worked significantly
 wings advantage those didnt being soured mainly 
injury players involved troy crowder who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered

put scotty bowman pat burns any other better coaches 
league behind bench detroit team could beat anybody
