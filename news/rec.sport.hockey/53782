rob zettlerseasonth
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradecc

zettler gave sharks every bit hes got year unfortunately still
wasnt enough make him any more than marginal nhler he works
hard sure better than average defense prone 
costly penalties defensive lapses times while being basically 
offensive zero goal assists games he would hardpressed
 make team next year

david williamsseason nd
acquired free agent from new jersey
gradecc

imo williams most valuable defenseman sharks 
playing combination good offense goals assists games 
good defense he playing first part season kansas city
 good neither offensively nor defensively year appears 
 fluke although he improved towards end season he
 prone being out position defensively did demonstrate 
playmaking skills made him teams leading scorer among defensemen last
year he would also hardpressed make team next year

jayson moreseason nd
acquired from montreal expansion draft
gradeb

after being touted teams top defensive prospects training camp
before more had rather disappointing he 
particularly good defensively had just points games he 
proceeded improve his game massively season becoming teams most
reliable defenseman whom team can count night night out play
steady defense providing occasional only occasional offensive flash
offensively he even more disappointing than last year points 
games his defense improved tremendously he probably best 
defensive part defense combination offensive defenseman

neil wilkinsonseason th
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradeb

wilkinson probably teams top defensive defenseman however
partially because injuries he same year he missed 
games total due nagging knee back injuries seemed slowed
even when playing he had often saved his defensive partners
 all he also had some solid games 
he can complete healthy he can still force

sandis ozolinshseason st
acquired nd round pick entry draft
gradei 

 time his injury december against philadelphia flyers
ozolinsh well track imo teams mvp serious knee injury
 game though forced him miss rest season games
 he still finished teams top scorer among defensemen points
which course tells more about lack offense sharks had from
 defensemen also tells ozolinshs abilities time he
 playing very good defense along excellent offense he still
susceptible socalled rookie mistakes probably defenseman who
made least them team rookie veteran he can come back
from his injuries he ready star

doug zmolekseason st
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradeb

zmolek had basically solid durable year being one only two sharks
 play all games season he solid defense 
after being billed offensive defenseman he didnt show points
he also prone penalties his penalty minutes second 
team however also indication he fearly when facing tough
physical opponents he his best when playing physically 
become fixture league he needs improve both offensively 
defensively cut down number powerplays he gives opponents
