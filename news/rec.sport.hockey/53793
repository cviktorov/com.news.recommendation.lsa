what leafs do i am leaf supporter 
i say leafs going down four unless 
 nothing short miracle stroke genenius hits
pat burns

 you were pat burns what would you do

living bay area i do get enough leaf coverage
 pull something out bag i would appreciate comments
 leafdetroit rd line matchups here basic
idea

andreychuck borchevsky have business playing against 
 wings too small key any leafs success
 have clark he only centre who can have
any presence within stick lengths slot where 
hell anderson anderson can days past get under peoples
skin put little more bluntly anderson has asshole
he used good we need him now 

perhaps perhaps leafs can shut down detroits second line
i dissappointed see shepard yserbeart flying last night
 guys swing players wings last year 
did major choke playoffs were blame quick
exit wings has happen again clarkandersongilmour
should able out hustle line anderson should do 
nasty yserbeart clark should bang hell out sheppard 
score gilmour score

suggestions clarkeandersongilmour vs sheppardyserbeart
 andreychuckborchevsy vs detroit checking line
 torontos checking line vs yzermanfedorovprobert pray lots

 suggested i would bench andreychuck borchevsky stir things up
 through monkey wrench detroits game plan however
 detroit coaching would dumb enough play 
checking line against finesse players well 
let them play

 potvin can faulted goals keep him 
 van hellamond can faulted leafs demise either
 wings defense shut down leafs especially slot

i hope pat burns realizes his team outhit outskated 
outcoached monday night loss because poor goaltending
 officiating calls drastic measures tee off next monday

go leafs
