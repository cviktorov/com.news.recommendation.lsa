bryan murray has done very little gmyzerman fedorov cheveldae
chaisson whole russian strategy product previous
gmmurray has made couple decent tradesthats about 
 would hardly rank him best gm

 many teams nhl who have taken liking russian players
 whole russian strategy specific detroit devellano
who gm before murray what previous gm also did trade 
away several players who have gone do well other teams most
notably my memory murray craven who had few very good years 
philly after leaving here also its volume trades 
necessarily improve team quality them trading adam oates
 bernie federko just plain stupid even federko used 
great player one time most murrays trades have worked significantly
 wings advantage those didnt being soured mainly 
injury players involved troy crowder who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered


devallano went earlier more extensively russian strategy
than anyone elseand first gm waste high draft choices
 young russiansdevallano would still gm he succombed 
demers pleading make oatesfederko et al tradewhich 
deal sealed his fate

murray has made some decent tradesno doubtbut more
due stupidity cheapness other teams than brilliance 
his partwashington too cheap pay ciccarelli so 
essentially gave him awayand carson really big anchor 
 team he able sucker rookie gm give him paul
coffey deadweight

 detroit still fails year because he one defenseman short
 he have wasted opportunity because manson available
 he unable pull trigger his judgement he
has enough what hes gotyzerman doesnt have many more
years his prime
