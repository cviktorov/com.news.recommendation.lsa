all fine i never said murray bad gm i merely said
 he isnt best gm hockey even contender honor
 murray great you claim wings would have won stanley cup
 now probably more than once he great gm you claim

i think you missed one my points takes more than great
gm win stanley cup even once some guys list you
gave earlier never won one i agree you i could probably argue
back forth days avail about who best gm hockey
 matter opinion who say my opinion any better 
than yours yours than mine point my original original
post well stated murray has gm abilities 
 coaching abilities which leads below

 he poor coach you claim he would have been intelligent
enough hire coach push team next level success

i think point theres personal emotional element involved here
which transcends murrays logical thought outsiders its fine 
us say he should hire different coach fact he has talked about
doing so past press here detroit least has so
built up business about murray never getting past second round 
 playoffs coach i think he has taken upon himself 
prove world he capable coaching team past second
round he needs papers say get monkey off his back
so becomes matter intelligence pride foolish
 let pride stand way sound logic perhaps were all
 little way from time time i think eventually hell step down
from behind bench concentrate his gm duties team 
improve result

i think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent
 gm work sense once he steps down coach well see how
good gm he really 

 murray average unspectacular nhl coach pretty good gm
so none true anyway

i may agree everything youve said its been fun discussing
 you
