paul stewart worst most biased ref presently nhl
he called total penalties habs one nordiques
 nords penalty came ot stewart being exnordique himself
 looking call penalties habs while letting nords
get away murderwe robbed

 patrick roy reason game lost ron hextall 
reason quebec won everybody said would come down goaltending 
goaltending key etc etc well key doesnt quite fit youre
montreal 

i dont buy all roy reason game tied 
would have been case had dionne kept his cool 
hextall gave up very questionable goals himself 
both dionnes bellows shots were misplayed hextall just because
his gaffes were early game one seems care roy stood his head 
 first minutes game when nords were rushing from 
endtoend kamenskys minibreak after tying goal first shot 
young ot were both excellent chances stopped roy roy outplayed hextall 
 most game roy becomes villain hextall hero 
because roys team didnt make full use opportunities

hextall other hand had lot lucky bounces he played very 
well haller shot off post ot rebound bouncing over 
bellows stick brunet breakaway chances leclair all 
those opportunities were finished off montreal cost them
hextall wasnt particularly brilliant those plays 

blaming stewart just 
excuse avoid facing fact roy allowed what one worst
goals he could possibly allow he even saw whole shot dammit

sure excuse just goal timing stank against
 explosive team like quebec gave them opportunity too many 
 powerplay totally unnecessary

montreal played solid game although still dont know how clear
traffic front net loss schneider hurt even more 

i disagree roy played well because he wasnt screened whole night 
 defense st time season played remarkably keeping sakic
nolan sundin out slot most night

normally i would say any team blows goal lead less than 
five let alone two minutes go regulation time playoff game 
especially needs smacked upside collective heads i dont
think team loss although keane should have been able clear 
 zone just prior first quebec goal 

 most certainly team loss leclair missed his opportunities
 did bellows brunet dionne took bad penalty damphousse lebeau
were silent carbonneau savard were step behind all night roy gave
up bad goal roy means can singled out loss

roy paid big money 
play he looked like player industrial league sakics shot

 hextall didnt dionnes goal please roy paid big money because
 his value compared other goalies he still top 
when you consider defense lack one played front him
 most season

demers should start racicot next game he should let
 damn team read papers next day twoand maybe 
article possible

 montreal media quickest heap praise hurl derogatory
comments against habs better than uninformed fans why should
 read papers played minutes burnsian hockey shut
down quebec all need tonight rest series 
extra 

red light face quebecrubbish thats guaranteed way end 
series who would taught lesson 
 fans media racicot perhaps certainly rest team

i didnt think wraparound bad second goal i also didnt
think scott young should have gotten around defender cant remember who
 first place you correct shouldnt have gone 
regardless

 you mean goal should never have gone because should never
have been ot i agree goal itself great piece work
 young roy had both near far posts covered young flipped 
puck up under roys arm he wrappedaround net bad goal all
