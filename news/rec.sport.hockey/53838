i mean original poster looking devils victory
 tape delay didnt happen game 

i original poster just complaint about 
coverage meaningless yankee game before playoff devils game

oh i apologize theni misinterpreted you

 problem offence taken 

 all teams patrick i least dislike devils

 sad just lover sport team can 
 metro new york area over decade still exist just
 nonentity 

how espns coverage anyways i think starts tonight

were getting sabresbruins replacement game probably
so you while devilspenguins game played scny 
islanderscaps overflow game sca scny plus 
sabresbruins ends early well go devilspenguins game
assuming espn follows previous patterns we got last
minute islandersrangers all overtime two weeks
ago espns coverage started last night accident one
 more other writers have pointed out couldve gone wild
hog wrestling evening instead
