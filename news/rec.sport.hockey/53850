 thanks goals steve smith 
 i dont see why more people dont blame grant fuhr goal smith 
 put his own net its common play puck back your own goalie when
 deep your own end under little pressure from offensive team
 fuhr had been position puck would have never crossed line

from account doesnt sound like you even saw goal mike smith
came out from behind his own net fired breakout pass hit fuhr 
back leg fuhr backing up time never saw what
happened puck went straight off fuhrs leg net fuhr never
had chance play back goaltender fact perry berezan
 calgary had just dumped smith retrieving 

 unfortunate happened smith nice guy only rookie
 time his birthday too all blame lies him starting
 peewee coaches tell players never make crossice pass front 
 own net too much chance having intercepted hitting 
goaltender whatever

 people who say smith cost oilers series i can only
say he certainly didnt cause team lose other three games
 reason powerhouse team like edmonton tied late
 third period th game second round everybody team
has take responsibility them even being situation
