 blues led best goalie nhl season curtis
 joseph shutout hawks blues playing like did 
 clutch n grab shoot puck out its incredibly boring 
 watch works
 
 finally non blues fan agrees joseph great goalie i think he
 should win vezina year least share barrasso who also
 has been shadowed marios amazing performance
 

i too think joseph has had great year should considered 
vezina i think barrasso joseph should two strongest candidates
 year i dont believe all hype roy belfour now potvin
receive goaltending i do think great nets
 i would rather have curtis tommy fuhr nets during years
playoffs big name tenders always seem have strong defense front
 them goaltenders get most credit i would rather face shots
 game than have rely joseph saving goalie going 
face shots i would rather have joseph barrasso facing them

jay

ps go quebec i know mclean several others should mentioned
 candidates years vezina i am partial joseph barrasso
 season
