 so other words roussel shuts out sharks soderstrom shuts out
 penguins thats immaterial because coaches decision come 
 joe think about what youre saying who played very significant
 why played them whats irrelevent low gaa against good teams
 better than low gaa against bad teams context comparing two
 goaltenders low gaa better higher gaa low gaa against good
 teams much much better than higher gaa against bad teams context
 comparing two goaltenders

lets start over im arguing about who better goaltender id
take soderstrom right now what i am saying roussel can 
netminder gaa difference less than half goal per game less than
 after last night save percentages close records
 similar i just dont see how you can label roussel 
 most disappointing player flyers season

you say soderstrom played against better competition may very well
 way knowing how roussel would have performed 
those games besides against better scoring teams like pittsburgh
 defense more keyed up than against san jose

 same
 roussel ranger game two real scoring chances one he made 
 great play other he saved mistake from other player 
 you were judging roussel game alone you have very little go 

 im just judging roussel game alone ive seen him play
 past two seasons philly before hershey its just
my opinion i think hes got what takes course i thought 
about mark laforest too i never did about wendell young so im
batting judging hershey talent since hextallera

 rangers game you can say he saved mistake 
offensive player you like rou had his leg position make 
save he didnt wouldnt have mattered rangers player didnt
get puck up would have been goal breakaway thats
what goalie wants do take away much possible force 
shooter beat him

 you were look tie against habs you saw goalie
 stand his head get shutout goalie action roussel
 doesnt have game like him

i seem remember roussel doing excellent job against pittsurgh 
opening night give flyers tie against twotime defending
champs take anything away from soderstrom because he 
senational game agains habs you cant tell me 
montreal player had open net shoot some point during game
 just flat out missed mistakes both offense defense 
part game thered never shutouts

anyway im happy flyers have both soderstrom roussel 
im going argue about anymore besides current
game winning streak expectations soaring next year i
dont want piss you off point you dont sell me any
tickets next season
