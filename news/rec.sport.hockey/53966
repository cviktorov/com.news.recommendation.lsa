jagr has higher francis has had more points take from
 informed observer ronnie francis has had much better season than
jaromir jagr take anything away from jaro who had 
decent year although didnt live up expectations some

bowman tended overplay francis times because he bowmanstyle
player he plays hard all times doesnt disregard his defensive
responsibilities good leader bowman rewarded him increasing his
ice time

jagr can very arrogant juvenile display me first attitude
 rubbed bowman wrong way caused him lose some ice time

throughout year francis consistently recieved more ice time than
jagr althouhg i have never seen stats subject i am pretty
sure jagr had more points per minute played francis when
you add jagrs better rating i think becomes evident
 jagr had better season francis had bad one


 actually what i think has become more evident you determined 
 flaunt your ignorance all cost jagr did have better season than
 francis suggest otherwise insult those modicum 
 hockey knowledge save your almost maniacal devotion almighty
 plusminus most misleading hockey stat available

 until nhl publishes more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
 time per game some measure its quality ie player put out
 key situations like protecting lead late game he matched up
 against other teams top one two lines shorthanded etc i would
 much rather see disappear altogether instead having its dubious
 merits trumpeted those little understanding its implications
