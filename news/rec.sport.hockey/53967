 boondock saskatchewan weedville alberta
 

 biggest advantage kids from boondock weedville have 
availability ice san jose area we have population 
 population served ice arenas contrast kamloops
british columbia has population about has rinks 
 also myriad ponds pools etc freeze winter down here
its hard find kid without bicycle up its hard find kid
without pair skates before you say what does he know hes from
california let me say i born raised trail british columbia
 town about lots ice winter my father did radio
play play local team trail smokeaters who way were
 last canadian team win world championship back i 
 skates almost soon i could walk have been playing recreational
hockey about years

 when last time you saw hockey league inner city
 insurance alone big enough barrier
 
 inner city isnt only place poor
 i think biggest barrier hockey inner city ice play 


lack ice big factor costs bigger factor both my kids play 
 santa clara valley hockey association season which just ended
cost me per kid membership hockey usa plus per kid club
dues hockey usa fees cover excess medical insurance club dues
cover ice time officials trophies etc other areas have similar fees unless
 city government subsidises some costs stockton does

 way most ice arenas located what could called inner city
areas eastridge vallco exceptions redwood citys rink 
industrial area bay rd near berkeleys near ashby martin luther
king stocktons oak park sacramentos older section downtown
i forget name street fresnos out edge town just west
 santa rosas nice rink its older section town
dublins outside town off most rinks old expensive
 run huge electric bills insurance premiums you want buy ice
time expect pay around per hour any rinks some them
give you minute hour your money others give you minute hour 
include resurfacing time fee
