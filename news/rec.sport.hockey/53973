 jagr has higher francis has had more points take from
 informed observer ronnie francis has had much better season than
 jaromir jagr take anything away from jaro who had 
 decent year although didnt live up expectations some
 
 bowman tended overplay francis times because he bowmanstyle
 player he plays hard all times doesnt disregard his defensive
 responsibilities good leader bowman rewarded him increasing his
 ice time
 
 jagr can very arrogant juvenile display me first attitude
 rubbed bowman wrong way caused him lose some ice time
 
 throughout year francis consistently recieved more ice time than
 jagr althouhg i have never seen stats subject i am pretty
 sure jagr had more points per minute played francis when
 you add jagrs better rating i think becomes evident
 jagr had better season francis had bad one
 

 actually what i think has become more evident you determined 
 flaunt your ignorance all cost jagr did have better season than
 francis suggest otherwise insult those modicum 
 hockey knowledge save your almost maniacal devotion almighty
 plusminus most misleading hockey stat available

 until nhl publishes more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
 time per game some measure its quality ie player put out
 key situations like protecting lead late game he matched up
 against other teams top one two lines shorthanded etc i would
 much rather see disappear altogether instead having its dubious
 merits trumpeted those little understanding its implications

thank you posting person who first brought up 
fact jagr has much higher than francis i can assure you
 i brought up example absurdity 
comparisons even same team i never ever thought anyone
would argue jagrs higher actually reflected better twoway
play

 my opinion franciss low purely result him being asked
 play against opponents top scorers all times fact he
can chip points while neutralizing other teams top center
 testament how valuable he even his suffers 
other hand jagr how big fast skilled he cant even get
 points matter how inflated his 

 way dont get me wrong i like jagr he may lazy
floater he turns exactly right times like
overtime playoff games
