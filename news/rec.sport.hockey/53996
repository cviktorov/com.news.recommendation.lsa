i feel jury still out tim cheveldae playoff goalie
he average his first playoffs last year he had horrible
start played great last ten games after he benched
his gaa even horrible start last year year
i think hes going play very well he has detroit going
 win cup he wasnt sharp game he didnt have 
i thought he looked pretty good yesterday

great write up wingstoronto series thus far i agree just
about everything you said chevy shouldnt have let shot from
 right point first goal mikorov i think other than 
wings looking good chevy holding his own great maybe

chevy has let soft goals so far all didnt matter
however his recent history has been inconsistant play comes up
big when counts score i think when goal you mentioned
 scored third period when looked like toronto coming
back chevy exceptional i can see him barraso style playoff
goalie inconsistant when theres nothing line
 comes up big when really needed i guess well both find out
