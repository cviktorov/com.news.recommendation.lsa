isles picked one hellofatime get first win all year after being
down after periods caps seemed have game hand playing steady
defense getting great goaltending from tabaracci isles power play
philosophy continues dumpandchase which except boardaholics like
flatley doesnt work against caps i hope al realizes have too
many talented finesse players so why carry puck setup 
last nights game any omen isles could way ole
championship form coming from behind late game my advice caps 
 pounce those healy rebounds flatley showed alot heart playing 
last period overtime despite almost swollenshut left eye injury
suffered hands dale hunter ray ferraro has arrived just time 
 playoffs showing fiesty hustle us islander fans remember from 
italian from past john tonelli tonelli who won similar game
against pens game playoffs isles scored two late third
period goals send game ot tied ot tonelli scored game
winner send isles next round isles have lacked tenacity
 years perhaps its back good see coliseum packed just
like ole days good luck isles rest way
