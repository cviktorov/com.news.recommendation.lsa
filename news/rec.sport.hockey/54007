lots debate about virtues bryan murray vs pat quinn gm
deleted randy graca seems think murray best gm league
i think quinn one several who better

plus his team quinns has improved much greater amount than detroit since
he took over them

how do you figure both vancouver detroit did same thing last year
 both won division had close same number points
 both went down first round playoffs before finally
escaping games both got knocked out second round 
teams should have been able beat less talent specifically
 i remember correctly third place teams how does make vancouver
more improved further im mistaken wings had more points than
vancouver end season albeit many 

when quinn took over vancouver several years ago last year 
regularily missed playoffs i cant recall missed playoffs
 year before his hiring probably did quinn has improved 
team from nonplayoff calibre serious contender

when murray took over detroit were about team 
contender win norris division possibly even stanley cup
contender

so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over gm
quinn one example better gm than murray
