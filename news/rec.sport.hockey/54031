wow guy seems out prove something his old team boston
which sweeney you askwell course bob sweeney one boston
let buffalo get hold still have sweeneys which makes things
slightly confusing game winner ot game another
big goal seconds after fuhr made point blank saves why
grant has rings put buffalo ahead rd yes neely countered
 minute later hadnt course buffalo going ahead after being
tied shutting down another few great scoring opportunities i
think boston would have notched first win series

well sabres havent made end series yet 
i certainly feel theyve got boston right were want themactually
theyve got them position neither buffalo nor boston felt
 would come about one more astronomical game fuhr few more
heroics rest team team sport afterall i
think borque neely jouneau sp company gonna swinging
 new stick weather perfect golf season real soon im 
gonna waiger anything because ive seen some really strange
things happen both pro college hockey

talking about golfwas hockey swing golf swing baseball
swing hawerchuck used last shot game khmylev
deflected big one whole ot all minute 
tesiment buffalos ability really persistent grind out
 end something werent necessarily regular season 
sabres pushed hard forced borque blatently take down bodger 
 opening seconds i dont normally like penalties being called 
 ultracritical points blatent finally sabres
won faceoff werent hot dept rest game
when lafontaine scooped puck times when hawerchuck took his
shot quite boomer blue stopped one he took few steps
over get his own rebound slapped again without setting
 up i didnt realize went until announcer started screaming
 score score best seeing lafontaine jumping
up down skating little bit jumping some more skating
over brad may who he jumped
