 bowman geniusjohnson isnt bowman great coachjohnson
 very good one however bowman really modern coach 
 patricks solution having him only run team game days 
 delegate most daytoday responsibity assistants 
 shrewd managerial decision patricks part 

imho bowman perfect coach group players 
 time johnson perfect coach two years ago his 
group players i would say we have been very lucky here 
pittsburgh order coaches came one 
excluding unfortunate circumstances which brought about 
change immense talent penguins roster 
year tougher bowman keeps egos check johnson 
other hand able inspire younger inexperienced players 
 new heights both coaches have had different strengths both 
 which came exactly right time 

another person also mentioned bowman perfect coach 
 time since nobody can argue his decisions how can 
you argue coach best record hockey anyway 
playing great coach like demands respect which also 
keeps egos check 

just couple ideas
