i one am happy about rangers hiring keenan its too bad 


i agree keenan excellent choice did you see mike
lupicas column sundays news my sentiments exactly i
think he just may one instill some hunger fire
 hearts next season either hes going 
 kicking alot butt

reading through most hockey news i dont see many ranger fans writing 

im here am new group have been keeping fairly
quiet you know doing lurking thing i dont have 
sense how many rangers fans list either i 
am diehard ranger fan i guess i have i sat 
garden throughout penguins led marios goals decimation 
 them am sick abundance talent has
been totally untapped lack heart displayed 
season


i have some final questions about way team handled last
dreadful stretch

 knowing needed offensive help from blueline why didnt we see mike
hurlbut who played pretty well when he called up when leetch first went
down


hurlbut injured quite while im sure i
think he may have recovered time playoff run 
 so like you question why he wasnt used


 why joe kocur playing every night he bob probert who 
tough also can play


i believe kocur used many instances his intimidation 
factor granted he seemed get awful lot ice time 
 reason alone you have realize when team 
 doing any real physical intimidation id like have nickel 
 every time jd said theyve got take body more 
youve got least have some illusions 

 how come paul broten relegated street clothes end 
season least he plays some heart character draws penalties 
plays when hes ice he doghouse some reason

i agree i dont know

 joe cirella enough said


sorry i dont agree you here i think joey c did good
job filling when he asked i cant imagine its
easy going from near ice time being full timer i dont
seem remember him turning puck over blue line too
much failing clear zone he worked hard 
least didnt make any rookie mistakes he said himself 
interview he can only give what he has he did 


ranger fans may suffering were some most loyal unlike islander
fans who only show up when team wins


absolutely i think attendance garden better 
last day season than any average night 
islanders

 
fought series mario amazing


 man awesome way im enjoying playoffs more
now rangers arent them i can really appreciate
all glory mario getting without hating him because hes
 opposing team he deserves all far im
concerned
