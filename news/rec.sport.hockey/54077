 first all i think when espn covers game do wonderful job 
 last night i felt same way i really hate watching devilspens game 
 everyone knows devils going get ass kicked why even 
 bother showing them i so bored espn people dont seem have
 any brain after sundays last night games still going 
 show devilspens thu sun what hell thinking about i 
 think keep up like nhl never get major network contract
 id rather see capsisls game which more exciting 

 now i just hope all baseball games rained out espn so atleast
 we can get diffrent hockey games
