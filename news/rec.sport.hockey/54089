its true vancouver did make playoffs many year before 
quinn came those years smythe division loti mean lot
tougher division than norris also known snorris division
vancouver had play edmonton calgary both very legitimate stanley
cup contenders eight times year while detroit got play 
powerhouses toronto minnesota now edmonton hardly even force
 league smythe even has mighty san jose sharks while

them thars fighting wordshardly forcegeezmiss playoffs
once years even after making final four times 
last five years everyone thinks its doomsville

over same period time which vancouver improving so 
everybody norris except st louis detroit had improve just
 keep up competition division had improve 
lot get better than competition norris

bryan murray inherited team very little talent really good
players had yzerman burr probert about 
 doubt some dispute whether burr probert were good 
rest were either very green rookies washed up veterans only reason
 got far did years before murray came due 
coaching demers who least first got every last ounce effort
possible out his team even his coaching began degrade


fedorov primeau kozlov lidstrom sillinger konstantinov drake
kennedy racine cheveldae were already pipeline due 
devellanomurray inherited guysin addition yzerman
probert carson chiasson etc

 number reasons why detroit wasnt bad shape standings
wise when murray took over vanc when quinn took over some which
i outlined above murray did have any better personnel work 
 outset than did quinn exception yzerman one player
cannot alone make team stanley cup contender im sure everyone
reading agree 


noquinn had far lessmurray took over detroit time 
take advantage all devellanos good draftingif devellano
had given demers request make oates trade he might
still gm
