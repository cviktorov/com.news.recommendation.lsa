i dont think trading kisio intrinsically mistake however trading him
 rd round pick would he should have been worth lot more than 
rd round pick playoff team fact i would intimate offers
 sharks got year kisio were way greater than just rd round pick

hindsights nobody expected kisio have his nd best career year

besides without kisio sharks would have tanked even earlier 
 season gund might have gotten little more serious
about getting joe murphy guy who definitely would around
 years from now when sharks do make playoffs

what else could done gunds offered million murphy 
oilers wanted prospects which sharks declined give which i think 
correct

i didnt mean imply gunds offer wasnt enough gunds offer
 right too late season m offered november
lets sather buy replacement murphy season make 
playoffs year m march doesnt help sather his
immediate objectives doesnt help long term objectives only 
prospect draft pick does way should sharks do 
however getting back whatif games had kisio been traded 
chicago last year sharks go october maybe gund
panicks sooner november heres another whatif twist chicago
would have had kisio season never go after murphy 
first place because kelly having his best season bigger guys 
chicago so gund has competition so ferriera sather keenan
all look like geniuses

 broken fax machine ferriera keenan maybe kingston
 maybe even green lose jobs kind makes you
shiver doesnt 

bottomline every black scenario any you can concoct 
kisio leaving i can concoct equally bright one

 kisiofiasco cause ferierras down fall i hope
 wasnt because he tried trade kisio because he screwed 
up nonetheless im sorry ferierra kingston gone i wish gund
would follow

 what have gunds done exactly caused you wish were
gone 

 you serious
 let ferierra go
