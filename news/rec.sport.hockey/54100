i knew despite lack full game telecast last week still
too much hockey atlanta atlantas abc has declined pick up any
playoff games till may even when show games may may
 continue skip first half hour telecast i know 
 still better situation compared rest georgia alabama etc 
 still pretty annoying least pittsburgh we had network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted local affiliate


i asked them what problem i told them local rating 
 bad considering first nhl game shown after long time
without much promotion besides syndicated programming afternoon
 usually low rated so what did have lose showing nhl playoffs
she told me had contractual obligations i asked her golf
 shown oin abc would contractual obligations come way how come
contractual obligations didnt come way last weeks telecast she
 couldnt give me coherent answer


also i added atlanta had one highest neutral site game
attendances demographics were good i think abc other networks
should begin tie high rated programs like roseanne 
 thier sports programming
i hope everyone atlanta who reads bboard calls wsb complain
bitterlyt about tell them you stop watching news telecasts
since seem very unprofessional handling situation

 lady did seem settle single reason sometimes reason
 low ratings another time she says contractual obligations
