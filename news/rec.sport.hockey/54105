paul stewart worst most biased ref presently nhl
we robbed

 patrick roy reason game lost ron hextall 
reason quebec won 

i dont buy all roy reason game tied 
would have been case had dionne kept his cool 
roy stood his 
head first minutes game when nords were rushing from 
endtoend kamenskys minibreak after tying goal first shot 
young ot were both excellent chances stopped roy roy outplayed 
hextall most game roy becomes villain hextall 
 hero because roys team didnt make full use opportunities

whoa what you effectively doing implying player plays
really well he stores up mistakes can used later time ths
 so roy villain you so succinctly put because he
allowed very cheap goal you think roy outplayed hextall perhaps you
should get tape game watch first minutes third
period nhl goaltenders make some great saves did 
would nhl first place i do expect any particular
goalie able make great saves all time even though 
 occasionally required however when comes routine shot like
sakics especially crucial time game i dont think 
 any legitimate excuses 

hextall other hand had lot lucky bounces 
description lucky bounces
hextall wasnt particularly brilliant those plays 

i am arguing hextall brilliant i am arguing 
relatively weak wrist shot from outside circle shold result 
 goal 

 just goal timing stank against
 explosive team like quebec gave them opportunity too many 
 powerplay totally unnecessary

 onegoal game less than minute go thing 
just goal i have defended dionne taking penalty
eitherin fact i think boneheaded move led one goal
only montreal had two goal lead my main concern second 
goal

 most certainly team loss leclair missed his opportunities
 did bellows brunet dionne took bad penalty damphousse lebeau
were silent carbonneau savard were step behind all night roy gave
up bad goal roy means can singled out loss

what you say about skaters absolutely true realize 
game effectively won you could watch any hockey game fact you
could watch any sporting event period spend hours discussing what
ifs wrt missed opportunities important when final
result decided i get time soon ill watch game again 
email you list lucky montreal bounces list quebec offensive
screwups montreal leading minute go goalie
 last line defence i grant extra attention 
focussed him sometimes without justification roy gave up lousy
goal team cannot afford goal

roy looked like player industrial league sakics shot

 hextall didnt dionnes goal please 

who cares what value justify one lousy play totally
unrelated lousy play i could do hextall critique youd like 
youre going assess his performance keep mind he made key
saves key times

roy paid big money because
 his value compared other goalies he still top 

 record i did say roy one top goaltenders 
 league fact i agree he 

 montreal media quickest heap praise hurl derogatory
comments against habs better than uninformed fans
 
i assume you referring me however i have pointed out i think
 loss can blamed roy i have said he sucks nor do i think ive
made any other derogatory comments you regard objective
 informed fyi observations derogatory i really cant help you
