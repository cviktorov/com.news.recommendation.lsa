well well dont like our defenders mainly lumme numminen

about correct numminen lumme


 rteemu selanne
 
compared kurri selannes points too high lets make 

 kurris points too low kurri selnne

 well canada cup world championships largely due efforts 
 markus ketterer goalie players listed above luck theres
 presumably lot decent players finland wouldnt superstars 
 highest level still valuable role players however my guess would 
 finnish canada cup team would team nhl

wow now looks like you dont like our players what about guys like
nieminen jutila riihijarvi varvio laukkanen makela keskinen even
 he aging ruotsalainen main difference between finnish north
american players our players tend better larger rink
 canadian defenders usually slower defenders europe 
 i think more our success than ketterer luck though
 helped i think main reason team worked well
together


thats true game so different here europe compared nhl northame
ricans better small rinks europeans large rinks average
european player from sweden finland russian tsechslovakia better 
skater puckhandler than his nhl colleague especially defenders nhl
 mainly slow clumsy selnne has also said finnish smleague
game more based skill than nhl finland he couldnt get so many 
breakaways because defenders here average much better skaters than 
nhl also alpo suhonen said nhl selnnes speed accentuates because
 clumsy defensemen

i have admit best players come from canada those regulars
arent skilful regulars best european leagues also top europeans
 same level best northamericansexcept lemieux 
class his own
