i have been all islescaps tilts crap centre year all isles
wins justification vukota pilon play isles
vukota absolutely worst puck handler world he couldnt hit 
bull ass banjo al must remember few years back when mick 
scored goals one period against caps isles win i 
 astonished rest crowd wakeup al years later hes
gotten worse hes cheap shot artist always ends up getting
stupidsenseless penalties i think he would make good police officier

 pilon he cant carry puck out center ice himself he either
makes bad pass resulting turnover he attempts bring puck 
towards neutral zone skates right opposing skater he cant
stay his skates most forwards centers he either falls down 
committs penalty call up somebody from capital district al

 far playoffs isles difficult figure out caps
two good teams talent so inconsistent should meet first
round isles seem play up level competition so 
should play well against jersey tonite itll probably another tight goal
game last games hve been isles i wish when get lead
 could continue pour instead settling back defensive
shell letting opposition get back game al must understand he
cant do team what he did isles maybe al should got
 where bobby nystrom clark gilles john tonelli kind
 young minds we need behing bench fire al
