game summary

say anybody from buffalo reading where did you people get 
woman who sang anthems we had turn down volume

 flyers defense started out game showing everybody why flyers have
been shutting teams out lately holding sabres only shots 
first period showed everybody why playing golf sunday
when gave up shots last two periods maybe tommy told them 
he getting bored back 

mark recchi opened scoring so fast you blinked you missed after
buffalo won faceoff dumped tommy wrapped puck around boards
 eric way up his left eric dropped galley he sent ahead
 recchi steaming out zone mark skated center circle passed
 puck himself through legs richard smehlik skated around him 
 fuhr smehlik pulling him all way through zone his
stick recchi drifted right drifted back left slid puck back 
right past fuhr flyers lead so beautiful eric 
garry should turn down assists 

 flyers kept pressure fuhr while after he strong
 kept flyers from doing further damage game became defensive
struggle while sabres got first chance power play when
terry carkner took boarding minor crunching dale hawerchuk 
 boards flyers zone lafontaine got only scoring chance 
 terribly good one flyers smothered sabres power play mogilny got
 post after over th consecutive penalty kill flyers

keith carney took holding penalty taking down mark recchi 
give flyers power play best penalty killing team league
didnt allow flyers shot goal although flyers did create 
good scoring chance lindros who partially fanned his shot towards
 end period play started going end end everybody kept
missing net greg hawgood took interference penalty give
 sabres another power play couldnt get anything going 
fans expressed displeasure particularly when iced puck shots
were buffalo after flyers had led one point

mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods jay 
disappointed make playoffs discouraged considered
 rebuilding year after trade he seemed very happy way 
season went when asked he agonized over trade he said 
russ farwells trade his only issue him ed
snider far money yes some agonizing theyd do
 all over again when asked how coaching situation would handled 
next year he said its russ call russ evaluate things 
end season he feels theyre years away from shot cup
he expects get playoffs next year have shot division title
 following year shot finals year after based
 current level play anticipated improvements over summer

hes very happy realignment he called outstanding happy 
 current expansion feels talent pool big enough unflux
 europeans feels must make sure existing franchises stable
seemed like idea playing olympics booo said 
 definite split among owners certainly would only happen 
four years consensus

 sabres gave flyers second power play game when brad may
took tripping penalty second flyers had little trouble
getting started eventually did hawgood took pass he moving
throug neutral zone handed puck eklund just outside sabres
blue line along right boards eklund carried zone nad passed
across dineen who tried one timer from between blue line 
top left circle he half fanned sent puck trickling
through slot fuhr didnt know where though hawgood won 
race flipped essentially open net 

 mogilny breakaway he slipped through two flyers blue line
 went soderstrom he went backhander soderstrom 
all over 

 flyers took some bad discipline type penalties really hurt them
viacheslav butsayev took double minor roughing high sticking when
barnaby got under his skin drew one minor according gary dornhoefer
took dive get other video sabres coudlnt
get started ryan mcgill poked puck just after sabre carried 
flyers zone after bunch people poked dineen emerged 
headed other way started out brindamour hustled ahead 
make back off defenseman dineen let rip from top

 sabres still had lots power play time again took some time 
just get flyers zone when finally did flyers were all
over them boos began ring through building finally got through
soderstrom ugly goal smehlik took shot from top zone 
missed kicked out hawerchuk slot hawerchuk tried backhander 
he skated towards goal line right galley dove down block 
mistake he should have let soderstrom handle backhander worried
about rebound b barnaby who camped behind goal line right
next net well rebound dropped right next soderstrom 
mistake galley just laid watched barnaby get three hacks 
puck before he finally pushed through goalie he didnt even swing his
stick out try knock puck away goal two streaks
end flyers shutout hockey straight penalty kills

lindros put them right back power play high sticking
minor i think barnaby again time sabres were able get
set up quickly couldnt get too much quality goal sabres continued
 keep puck flyers end while after power play ended
things evetually settled down other very bad penalty mcgill
allowed barnaby get under his skin slashed his stick just before 
faceoff gloves were dropped mcgill started pounding crap out 
him during fight he gave barnaby head butt his helmet 
 meant match penalty slashing fighting major
 minutes power play time sabres barnaby only got 

 flyers were keeping them bay while only so long
 could do after couple good sabre chances audette handed 
ledyard point ledyard sent drive knocked down 
soderstrom lafontaine whacked bouncing puck from left side 
 net knocked over randy wood right soderstrom had
moved over play lafontaine since yushkevich carkner were waving
 puck instead picking up men wood just slid empty net
 close flyers lead lafontaine actually trying 
put net half fanned got break

 flyers got some shorthanded pressure sabres zone hasek
 strong finally keith carney passing ahead hawerchuk 
neutral zone hawerchuk sent good backhand pass mogilny flyers
blue line another minibreakaway mogilny he elected shoot from 
left circle he threaded needle get just inside far post 
 his th season ironically youth hockey tip between
 st second period tommy soderstrom talking about cutting off
angles

 all nd shots were sabres

 rd period pelle eklund blew golden opportunity get 
flyers lead back acton puck he dropped eklund 
 slot eklund held puck he slid through left circle until
he had almost angle all shoot from when he finally did shoot he
hit far post still during carryover power play time

than incredible almost goal randy wood skated around recchi hawgood
untouched soderstrom soderstrom goes down wood pokes puck under
soderstrom black object hits back net red light comes 
horn sounds crowd cheers up video replay booth some strange
reason meantime emrick dornhoefer try figure out what 
could reviewing well turns out taped up stick blade
 went net puck emrick mentions one criteria
 scoring goal puck must go net

dave hannan took out recchi got holding minor flyers
could get anything going all finally got set up way through
 were kept perimeter time ran out beranek stripped puck
from sabre offensive zone along right boards passed across
 eklund top left circle eklund saw dineen heading net
just inside right circle passed through him dineen fumbled pass
 twice directed hasek eklund swooped chipped bouncing
puck over goalie his th flyers

 sabres came right back lafontaine picked up puck his offensive
left corner slid bob erry behind flyers net erry started skate
out just dropped puck back nobody behind net mogilny flew
 skated around stuffed through soderstroms hole his th 
 tie game 

 hawerchuk took retaliatory roughing penalty flyers set up
 sabres zone stayed off faceoff high sabres zone 
 middle while brindamour wrestled puck dineen snuck through 
line wristed perfect shot low haseks glove side 

play started go back forth until hawgood took roughing penalty 
 flyers dumped puck sabres zone brindamour ledyard went
after rod got puck he backed away from right boards skated
 right faceoff dot passed between his legs dineen crashing
through slot all himself dineen waited patiently lifted over
 blocker hasek flyers lead rd hat trick season
 dineen th his career nd shorthanded goal game him th
 season

 carney took tripping penalty kill rest sabres
power play much action sabres got most 
chances flyers resulting power play

play went end end quite while after both goalies had 
make some big saves sabres werent able pull hasek time running 
out flyers wouldnt allow any consistant possession sabres
finally time running out ken sutton misplayed puck his own left
corner brindamour stripped away from him he pulled away found
dineen other side left circle dineen found acton 
right hasek he slid puck between two sabres defenders acton
chipped back far side hasek his th season 
 his th birthday all scoring shots were buffalo
 ice showered plastic drinking mugs handed out before 
game

so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who hadnt been tested much
 his last couple starts kevin dineen has career high point night
unless he had better night earlier season i dont think so
 flyers longest winning streak years goals only against
 three shutouts eric lindros th league even strength goals
despite missing games injury points out th clinched th place
since rangers lose tie breaker

 couple misc notes

forget mike keenan rumors press conference tommorrow 
announce he head coach new york rangers next year

 last notes i mentioned garry galley won barry ashbee award
 i failed mention award best defenseman

 times trenton has reported preeminent specialist from oklahoma
has looked over tommy soderstroms medical record determined 
further tests necessary near future

same paper had blurb about bill dineen being asked about whether he
expected back next year his response he wants come back
he feels he did good job year he would cheerfully accept 
role scouting farwell didnt want him back
