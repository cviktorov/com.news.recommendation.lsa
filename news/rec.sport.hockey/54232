i prefer
 watch hockey than seeing shots felix potvin slashing spearing dino
ciccerelli standing front net he has every right stand 
front net just crease

 i played roller hockey boy do i miss those days goalie i would
 scream my defense clear guys out slot i dont care hes
 crease get him hell away from me so i can see ball

i have agree wholeheartedly view i dont like see stickwork
 you have clear players away from front my personal favorite move
im goalie too give offeding player good whack back
 skates when ref isnt looking makes em go down like ton 
bricks doesnt cause injuries unless dont know how fall im 
talking about hitting blades here foot also makes 
player you hit anyone who sees really mad apt take stupid
retaliation penalty unfortunately also leaves your blocker out 
position short timei dont do shot likely short
side hmmmaybe i should mail potvin method french 
helpful diagrams course sure would nice see ciccerelli who
i have great deal respect btw hes big guy he plays
huge fall his back few times
