when draft year any coverage
i know upcomming nfl draft espn

anyone got details

paul kariya pick perhaps he wont last long 

i dont know exact coverage states canada covered
 tsn so maybe espn grab coverage i dont know

 picks
ottawa picks which means almost alexander daigle 
go hell either stay traded montreal quebec imo i would
take kariya he should alot leadership ncaa so far 
 world championships daigle didnt show his junior team

san jose get kariya

tampa bay either go russian kozlov i think thats 
 defenseman rob niedemeyer probably spelt last name wrong

 sharks appear leaning toward picking rob
niedermayer center his brother scott defenseman
picked nj couple years ago brought him 
physicaltryout week so ago from what i have read
niedermayer best skater draft plays both
offense defense isnt afraid physical play
defensively sharks looking pretty good terms 
defense prospects rathje sykora ragnarsson our
centers kisio et al getting old

 all small players sharks have i justs cant
see them picking yet another small player like kariya hed
just get bashed oppposition get separated 
shoulder
