 i agree all you might i suggest we getting all worked up
over nothing we all knew espns coverage going suck i mean have
you ever watched during regular season sportscenter coverage hockey 
sucks i mean really sucks espn does know hockey shot them 
ass i really pissed about last night coverage i go school ohio
i know indians suck so why show them i were bill clement i would
shoot myself

anyway after i calmed down after i realized were going show
overtime caps isles game i thought myself i knew going
 happen fact i remerbed myself praying least would keep even
 boring devils game

overall i think espn does care show hockey i firmly
belive have know respect fans ie because contract 
obligations screw you espn
