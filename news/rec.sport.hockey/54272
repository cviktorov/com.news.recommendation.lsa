i think threeheaded gms guiding principle keep veterans
 favor youngsters only offered significant advantage

doesnt sound like bad strategy me

 fact ferreiras original strategy which troika
proceeded simply continue implement wasnt exactly radical
shift policy when he ousted something people seem forget 
only real question whether did well ferreira could have 
he stayed whether basic strategy flawed since ferreira has been
quoated saying hes going do something different anaheim 
ducks my guess wasnt good practice paper
 hes tweaking bit second time around one also has wonder
whether strategy would have been lot better we hadnt had those
injuries whether were complaining about weather because 
earthquake collapsed root cellar

 course ferreira had also traded number veterans marginal
contributions before he fired so its clear would have
been different besides were marginal contributors

lets also forget ferreira came close trading kelly
kisio which rumors ive heard true over strong
objections other aspects shark management probably had lot do
 both his ouster threeheaded consensus oriented gm

imagine second where sharks would today fax machine
hadnt jammed

 without mullen werent going playoff team what good
does do them hang onto player whod rather elsewhere 

especially unhappy player isnt playing well because 
 id accuse mullen tanking his motivation simply wasnt 
 kind thing can affect team

 example from season skriko brought trial basis
 kept because his age i thought he decent
contributor worth keeping around

 youth movement has its advantages look gaudreau who
might still kc more veterans had been kept around 
you have find right balance

right balance what thats issue 

exactly time let skriko go we hadnt yet had major injury
bugs killed us later id much rather have skriko around than someone
like dean kolstad point wasnt choice since 
choice more one skriko vs someone like john carter i think 
right choice made time period
