i am ulf pgh fan what pisses me off about whole adam graves
ulf samuesson debate ulf plays hardhitting hockey nothing wrong 
 while graves does what he does when only way win game 
intentionally hurt someone which bites

jeesus i never thought id see day when i defended ranger

you obviously dont watch much hockey you think graves 
goon he one hardest working rangers check 
hardest working ranger he had goals year bad 
checking type player showed up every single game 
season unlike stiff messier he fearless throws clean
checks he also stand up someone after he hits them like
 pussy oaf

exactly my point youd watch games more closely youd see lot 
 goons going after him ulf one main reasons why less physical 
players pgh left alone ulf plays rough hockey only when 
other players putting rush mario jagr you want say anyone
 penguins cheap shot goon say its jennings caufield dontslander good defenseman because your favorite players cant beat pens
even when take dives like gartner try cheap penalties

 his slash lemieux fine cheap shot 
exception rule i bet you think mike gartner goon
because time he slashed hell out oafs arm last
year right after all he did get suspension 

hey thats fine player does something stupid he should penalized
including ulf mario youre likely see happen anyone else matter its pointless say any one person cheapshot goon because youll see everyone take cheap shot now especially youresomeone who shadowed much ulf
