 tuesday when raining chicago espn provided 
 bonus hockey coverage now seems though some fans ticked off
 nywash ot replaced angels game people must
 realize more baseball fans instead hockey fans us 
 baseball game scheduled air advertisers money paid so
 cant skip baseball game why dont you people chill out
 enjoy whatever coverage you can get

well partly because i ardent fan both sports would rather
see game nhl playoffs than game mlb
season even bb game involves red sox

espn may have had contractual obligations i understand part
 its bit inaccurate call us selfish just because we want
 watch watch game we love am i baseball fan selfish
when i get pissed cbs showing approximately one game per month
i dont think so

while espn may have contractual obligations we consumers
have right voice our displeasure how serving us
theres certainly nothing wrong
