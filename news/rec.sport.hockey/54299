im new system big hockey fan long suffering
ranger fan remember suffering builds character

i dont care i want my fcking stanley cup before i die aargh

ill happy win before i get out school way its going
i may here saying piled higher deeper before long



ranger fans may suffering were some most loyal unlike islander
fans who only show up when team wins
 has been observed many times its true definitely

i have feeling alot people out may like statement

 far worst band wagon fans pit fans least present
case point i know guy who just came hockey helltm from pitt u
him how bout pens fing awesome
me yeah beating up devils doesnt mean alot wait until
 meet boston andor detroit playoffs start

im saying true all waddlers fans seems 
 alot them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except
 theyre newly beloved waddlers best team game right now
 when theyre best team those fans disappear woodwork
