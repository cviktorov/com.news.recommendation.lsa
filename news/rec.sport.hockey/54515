game report deleted
 bad refing wont affect 
 series which should only go two more games all things being equal

wrong

 kings just put exibition hustle team play consistent 
pounding took back calgary series tied games each
 final score third goal emptynetter 
 third conacher

 official game report just my observations from stands

 melrose made wise decision put stauber back goal robb had
 something prove he did stopping while facing 
 fierce calgary attack were numerous highlight film saves

 kings third fourth lines rose occasion playing rough while
 avoiding bad penalties warren rychel scored gamewinner early 
 second period rookie defenseman alexi zhitnik scored first from 
 blue line late first


 dave taylor awesome he suffered broken nose partway through 
 second pariod checked from behind boards roberts who got
 game he came back late third ice when
 conacher scored empty netter 

actually third period his return did bring spark 
crowd players who played awesome defense third


 kings goto guys still producing goals from kurri granato
 sandstrom robitaille who have total points between them 

you forgot about gretzky any guys start scoring kings
 unstoppable continue great defensive work well


 mccreary sucks he called mcsorely high sticking someone who already
 ice sandstrom high sticking when he himself already 
 ice he missed many flagrant stick penalties including one from flame
 goalie jeff reese who followed granato out almost blue line where he
 crosschecked him he called game very inconsistently series 
 tickytack penalties first almost none third cant 
 nhl supply decent officiating

 i sitting directly across ice from ron nancy reagan when 
 empty netter scored nancy leapt out her seat both fists high
 air way go nancy


 series still too close call tuesdays game may deciding
one i expect king might put vernon back even though reese had two good
games la reese has historically been good la only second
time he lost move would good kings since vernon 
 sieve i am sure stauber get call kings

stauber net tuesday hopefully he provide another
stellar performance earn name robb stopper stauber


 firswt two lines kings have wake up while great see
you cannot depend pat conacher warren rychel all your offense
i expect sandstrom granato gretzky might put back together line
like were early season would leave kurri carson luc
 second paper two lines look powerful lets see 
can make real

i believe how arei know gretzky sandstrom he
has been putting number people left also carson robataille
kurri line once ignited light fire other lines
hopefully

go kings

dvb




 evident scoring drought getting luc after his slight
breakaway third i think he steamed bench emotion
might help him break his streak also i have noticed blake has had few
really good chances score has fanned shot wide injury
still affecting him
