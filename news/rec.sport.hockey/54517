im even going bother reply your ranting post letter 
addressed gary bettman you he can reply he wishes

 so your post addressed all i quote

 she said letter addressed bettman post which though
having pretty much same content entirely different entity 
addressed all when she puts letter mail i doubt 
say all i figure she wanted let people here see what 
since topic interests lot folks here thats entirely 
different purpose than sending letter bettman

unfortunately

 i guess i let you know didnt i

you do represent large body hockey fans any standard you care
 use define large people constitutes nothing more than tiny 
group fanatics way representative large body hockey
fans internet let alone one largest computer networks 
 world 

 largest computer networks world phrase definition 
 internet group whole she claims represent 
 business whether large large compared
 say number folks rsh who sending letter thank
him changing names least point just my
own curiosity i thought id look up official definition large
 dictionary reads

large having more than usual power capacity scope 
 exceeding most other things like kind quantity size

now i have idea how many letters bettman may have gotten issue
 how many people may have signed them people may up 
thereby validating definition i would also wager geographical
range signatures quite large which would give large scope

he might impressed size list names

why would he impressed unless were large 

i am course assuming you actually agree what you writing
 simply trying pain about whole issue hear
yourself speak 

i personally dont know whether i agree letter i have
very mixed emotions about i like names dont
think make difficult learn game might 
 shred validity change
