i would say letter clearly implies representation views

thanks speaking all those who didnt feel important
enough say something themselves 

i wouldnt say letter clearly implies representation 
views group you belong represents subset you
dont belong larger group which you do only because 
isnt moderated group

look several ways state opposing viewpoint three
 come mind follows

 say subtly result may clear
 say directly yet politely result probably spark some 
 interesting conversation
 say directly obnoxiously result validity goes right out
 window

i would agree unwarranted use said term entirely immature

you realize anything you say can most certainly 
used against you
