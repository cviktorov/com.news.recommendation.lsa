lets also forget ferreira came close trading kelly
kisio which rumors ive heard true over strong
objections other aspects shark management probably had lot do
 both his ouster threeheaded consensus oriented gm

imagine second where sharks would today fax machine
hadnt jammed

 other hand im hard pressed think any other real mistakes
fereirra made imagine indeed again we have benefit 
hindsight

lets say view sharks upper management attempt
 trade kisio major factor decision fire feirerra
im inclined take exactly opposite view should have kept
himhes obviously luckiest man hockey wonder what
sacrifice he made muse fax his job i guess

have fun
