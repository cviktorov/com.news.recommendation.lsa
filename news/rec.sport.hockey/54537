thats inner calm its boredom its being spoiled arenas
been quiet church many nights year too many us just
take winning granted its been seemingly forever since team
lost weve forgotten what its like feel real excitement 
surprise victory

i dont really agree entirely different high
 any rate first cup pens won i didnt think about anything
else i just watched mario all skate thing around ice now
 seems more question whether thirty years from now
young hockey fans may millions still ask us what 
like watch team thats what playing now i
 still nervous ever when devils were blasting shots 
barrasso final seconds game three so fun far from over
yet

im bored either most people i know say winning second cup
 better than first me nothing ever top first one
 im every bit excited year i am experiencing inner calm
 which susan originally referred inner calm boredom

 far arena general being boring well richards got right
its been way all season i attribute lot new fans who
just dont have same spirit knowledge longtime fans 
last tuesdays game i overheard man express surprise 
goaltender can get 
assist

anyone who follows sports regularity knows anything can happen
 any time im confident pens im also stupid enough 
think one minute its impossible new jersey blow them out
 series i doubt happen its possible bored uhuh
spoiled least forgot what excitement like living through
 amazing streak wasnt exciting i dont take darned thing 
granted god look chicago

 i see problem quietly savoring all anyway isnt gonna
last forever i intend enjoy while i can
