 picks
ottawa picks which means almost alexander daigle 
go hell either stay traded montreal quebec

i dunno about hat i have friends up genie who now saying 
ottawas gone soft daigle thinking hard about pronger daigle has
shown attitude latter part season many folks havnet liked
 after coming back from his second multigame suspension being
stupid hes really tanked his performance his stock dropping like 
rock 

also remember lot teh draft st stuff comes from assumption
hell traded quebec lots prospects its clear 
quebec would really willing pay lot him given his current
status hes still first round i dont consider him first pick lock
 any means point

its also possible senators posturing try bring down his
signing price since daigle has been taking some lindros lessons during thos
suspensions

imo i would
take kariya he should alot leadership ncaa so far 
 world championships daigle didnt show his junior team

san jose get kariya

 kariya wont go first three very simple reason hes 
leaving college i dont believe any expansion teams going 
use first someone who wont around another year two 
when equally good almost good stuff available can make
 immediate impact san jose seems leaning heavily towards
niedermayer reason kariya could go th th unless team can
convince him leave school early which i doubt


my cut things stand today

draft order

 ottawa daigle pronger
 san jose niedermayer unless ottawa skips daigle its open
 depends sharks can get deal him i dont
believe draft him keep him
 tampa bay whoever ottawa doesnt take maybe koslov
