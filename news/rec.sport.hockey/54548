 i one am happy about rangers hiring keenan its too bad 
 
 didnt hire him when smith fired nielsen maybe he could staightened 
 out 
 babies team made playoffs what team needs 
 little
 fire under butts
 
 reading through most hockey news i dont see many ranger fans 
 writing 
 im new system big hockey fan long suffering 
 ranger
 fan remember suffering builds character
 
 i have some final questions about way team handled 
 last
 dreadful stretch
 
 knowing needed offensive help from blueline why didnt we 
 see mike
 hurlbut who played pretty well when he called up when leetch first 
 went
 down
 
 why joe kocur playing every night he bob probert 
 who 
 tough also can play
 
 how come paul broten relegated street clothes end 
 
 season least he plays some heart character draws 
 penalties 
 plays when hes ice he doghouse some 
 reason
 
 joe cirella enough said
 
 ranger fans may suffering were some most loyal unlike 
 islander
 fans who only show up when team wins
 
 far stanley cup goes i think theres only one team can 
 test
 pittsburgh thats detroit would most entertaining 
 hard
 fought series mario amazing
 
 kurt
 
 i think joe kocus should play every night he big physical guy 
 he gets fans game some big hits both checks 
 fists its big advantage get crowd going plus he helps 
 protect other players notice very few fights when kocur 
 ice unless he i have seen people start go after essa 
 tikkanen only go slinking away when kocur steps i think he big 
 asset should third line special situation only play
 
 
 
 fast becoming game without goons i admit kocur may get 
fans game surely would rather see broten taking pass from
kovalev scoring breakaway goal put rangers up magic goals 
 third period rather than seeing kocur take another stupid penalty 
rangers giving up another powerplay goal 

 rangers need another top flight center who can take pressure off
messier first line nemchinov perfect third line center

so who goes beezer richter

kurt
