ive been under impression minnesota one possibly
 hockey state us so why team moving city 
texas owner greedy selfserving profiteer 
were stars really making profit city whoever
owned arena doing some price gouging


norman green claims he has lost money over last three years
 he has owned team when he bought team seemed kind 
obvious he going have deal few years red
before team started making profit again he gave impression
 he willing do so he claimed two years ago team
needed average only fans per game order pull profit
 season team averaged fans despite increasd ticket
prices i think teams attendence play clearly upward
trend which leaves me dumbfounded how he could ignore 
deciding move he even offered many concessions he rudely
demanded guaranteed season ticket sales cheap rent 
other two arenas town etc

oh well i guess bottom line green wanted immediate huge
returns dallas wasnt willing wait another year so mn 
dallas gave green pretty stellar deal play although i feel
minnesotas quite reasonable he also has some cronies down
 well all means minnesota without nhl team
 year two too bad nhl
