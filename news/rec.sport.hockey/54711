boards so full why dont you take cue fromm daryl just

series wrapped up

bravo tony

i too am sick all mindless fanatical blind faith jets fans who could 
prpbably predict end world more accurately than coutcome 
playoff series

now i admit i am mindless fanatica blind faith canucks fan
 unlike those from winterpeg i do need vent my spleen upon 
world how great my team i know i have confidence them 
thats enough

granted jets finished season hot canucks were having trouble
 vancouver has built themselves reputation being playoff team 
just ask any flames fan may win every series alway fight
 end ill admit last year great combine
 work ethic past new tallent present 
 tough beat note i did say would pummel every team meet 
 destroy greatest player playing today

now like any canucks fan i would love see them take cup i feel
 have good chance make out smythe shot 
detroit i cant see them losing st louis pittsburgh makes 
 cup id have put my money them yes even theyre facing 
canucks buffalo montreal quebec beat pittsburgh id choose 
winner vancuover detroit take cup

oh one parting note jets fans just how many times has 
winnepeg made finals 

go canucks

greg

devorski unfortunately helped taint otherwise brilliant display
 maclean canucks tied up jets so tightly i thought 
 were mailing them

btw gregnext time dont fall asleep geography class its pretty
sad when fellow norway can spell winnipeg properly guy 
north america cant

championships do have

six championship banners hanging from rafters stanley cup
