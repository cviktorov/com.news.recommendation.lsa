 she said letter addressed bettman post which though
having pretty much same content entirely different entity 
addressed all when she puts letter mail i doubt 
say all i figure she wanted let people here see what 
since topic interests lot folks here thats entirely 
different purpose than sending letter bettman

 damn good thing she did post since she claims represent
people recsporthockey

unfortunately

 largest computer networks world phrase definition 
 internet group whole she claims represent 

her sole purpose mentioning net steve gallichio has already 
pointed out lend weight her points through association 
internet other reason mention internet 
misrepresentation internet private corporation alison
would leaving herself wide open all kinds civil suits

 business whether large large compared
 say number folks rsh who sending letter thank
him changing names least point just my

 letter petition claiming represent large
proportion recsporthockey users implication significant
number internet users names can way considered 
large proportion recsporthockey which while we have way 
counting actual readership accessible hundreds thousands 
people persons more than flys fart windstorm
 
own curiosity i thought id look up official definition large
 dictionary reads

large having more than usual power capacity scope 
 exceeding most other things like kind quantity size

gee you looked up large dictionary what next two syllable 
words

now i have idea how many letters bettman may have gotten issue
 how many people may have signed them people may up 
thereby validating definition i would also wager geographical
range signatures quite large which would give large scope

let me suggest only place you likely envy magnitude 
 when you looking ways beef up your iq scores

he might impressed size list names

why would he impressed unless were large 

 i said he might impressed size list names 
 would have considerably larger even definition does
 account original context from which you lifted sentence

i personally dont know whether i agree letter i have
very mixed emotions about i like names dont
think make difficult learn game might 
 shred validity change 

well what hell your point you dont really know you have
 opinion about hockey issue you do know you dont like me
