thoughts game 


 flames played horribly dropping first game series 
los angeles sunday afternoon seemed more interested throwing
big hits than scoring goals physically dominated kings 
 only area dominated game plan rush net 
try take advantage young inexperienced la defence shaky
kings goaltending those plans fell wayside while flames
conducted steady march penalty box particularily stupid theoren
fleury taking five minute major game misconduct slamming warren
rychels face dasher while rychel his knees 

goaltender mike vernon played well could really faulted 
loss despite his wellpublicized poor record afternoon games he got
very little support from his defence clearing front net 
sweeping away rebounds fact marty mcsorleys goal actually went off
chris dahlquists skate front net 

thoughts game 


 flames came back strong second game evidently aware 
potentially fatal consequences losing both first two games home ice
 first period fairly even edge going kings calgary
came out strong second period simply dominated kings scoring
five goals take lead never relinquished en route win 

 deciding factors game were faceoffs special teams calgary
dominated faceoffs did game were able make better
use won faceoffs game than did first one calgary
also went powerplay while la only went gave up
 shorthanded goal joel otto las powerplay goal also came late 
game outcome already decided kings powerplay failed them when
 needed most st nd periods 

 flames lost rw greg paslawski suspected shoulder injury when he
 leveled alexei zhitnik right after scoring calgarys th goal charlie
huddy left game kings groin injury 

 game marred stupidity last minute first craig berube 
calgary took fiveminute major fighting plus game misconduct 
instigating when he went after tony granato apparent reason granato
drew minor some strange reason turtling perhaps followed
 seconds later warren rychel drawing major minor game misconduct
 hitting frank musil face his stick instigating 
fight musil got fighting major some similarily strange reason hardy 
yawney went toetotoe both got double minors gregson thought musil 
turtling amounted fighting yawney hardy throwing punches 
each other just roughing wheres guy from
