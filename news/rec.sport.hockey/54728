so whats stopping pocklington from going bank borrowing 
million dollars pay off his treasury branch loansi reading

according recent tsn report peter puck paying any interest
 treasury branch loans thats lot green

somewhere than pocklington business have gross revenues about
 million per yeari dont think he would have much problem
borrowing from his visa pay off his mastercard he wanted 

again according tsn virtually everything peter puck has already 
has liens against course we cant really sure 

pocklington point maximum advantage right nowand
he basically right northlands which creature 
city edmonton must give him better deal era escalating
salaries northlands city benefitted much he did during
 eighties from oilersand wealth generated oilers
success sharedbut finanical viability small market teams
has radically changed space couple years 
 oilers remain viable competitive need much more 
 revenue stream from concessions parking building advertising
 most every other professional sports franchise north america
has what once fair agreement shared wealth now
northlands sucking blood out oilers franchise

 oiler rationale regarding renegotiation player contracts 
 deal deal sather has spouted repeatedly pocklinton
has contract northlands until deal deal perhaps
 he included income he has received from his sale assets players
 gretzky income he has received expansion fees 
his revenues he wouldnt losing money he has admitted pulling 
money out oiler franchise put his other businesses 

 oilers have paid several times over what coliseum cost 
build bring edmonton prestige recognition throughout 
world essentially pricelessto nickelanddime oilers
just so northlands can use revenue sucked out oilers 
subsidize horseracing operations insanity

i think pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization 
i cant really blame him going after municipal subsidization 
he certainly entitled pocklington has sucked revenue
out oilers order prop up his failing business interests
pocklington trusted i doubt very much any oiler
team ever again make playoffs under pocklingtons stewardship
 soon player shows himself competent nhler expects
 paid accordingly he shipped off younger players 
draft picks
