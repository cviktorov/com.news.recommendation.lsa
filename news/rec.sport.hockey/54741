hi guys

what happened
 potvin didnt let six goals 
 wendel andreychuk woke up
 home ice lots yelling gardens gave leafs
 emotional edge
 refs calls especially last night tended favour leafs

 couple comments

 gilmour just because guy isnt one three
stars doesnt mean he leading team someone posted
 playoff point total hes something like fifth sixth
placeplus he walked away molson cup given 
accumulating points from three star selection during 
regular season

 officiating ive heard gripes from both ends 
one emotions very high series rivalry 
one stronger ones i know i do have agree 
officiating last night proleaf general except whoever
missed slash gilmours hand

 general i still think detroit has one better
chances vs pittsburgh though i think leafs would do better
against bluesbut well made out 
division problem i like both teams though im
supporting leafs underdog principle d

 waygilmour tiring out lot like bob probert 
playing aggressive hockey
 wayim any sort expert nor do i claim 
i just like watching good matchup
