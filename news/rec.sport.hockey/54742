 hart trophy goes player most valuable his team best
player league so your above arguement really worthless 

personally i always thought most valuable his team silly
why should best player league penalized because he plays 
team other good players why should lesser player picked solely
because hes best player weak team wouldnt weaker team 
helped even more best player league doesnt presence 
 best player league make other players team look
better too

 hart trophy orginally awarded time where people did think
 terms who best player rather terms who most
valuable team valuable his team should 
 considered synonymous best we talking about time when
honour attitude measurable skills were most important assets
 player brought his team his league his sport before
 onslaught professionalism which has clearly denigrated what 
formerly foremost peacetime pursuit glory

 hart trophy prize honour
