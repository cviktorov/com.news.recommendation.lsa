while i first congratulate blues victory i think must
 realized primary reason blues were able win curtis 
joseph when goalkeeper gets hot little opposing team can do
joseph should given entire city st louis because otherwise 
would probably game scheduled 

 game sunday blues caught few breaks without doubt
one referee constantly watching blackhawks looking reasons 
give them penalties second blues first goal resulted because puck
hit linesman blackhawks attempted clear linesman shot
 bretti can redirect anythinghull redirect another st louis
goals belfour tripped from behind he went make save someone
who didnt belong crease which means st louis player
finally overtime goal caused because someone kept belfour from getting back crease goalie way stop shot

i congratulate st louis beating hawks shame see
bryan murray finally advance campbell conference finals because joseph
wont able stop powerful red wing attack
