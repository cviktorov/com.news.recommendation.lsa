dear mr bettman 

alis letter deleted brevity

 rogers acidlaced response removed
maybe we should get together establish some kind mandatory maturity
level keep some stuff off air

roger
your responses might just exclude you from sharing your opinions
 you see same rights ali has mail her letter nhl
 same ones let you post replies mow her down like
wheat harvesttime she never said she represented entire
internet entire group recsporthockey she has every right 
state her opinion along those fifty sixty 
hundredodd folk whove agreed allow her list names 
bottom you may agree fine i really dont care
enough about name change care your name isnt attached 
so why moan complain you felt her words were leading well
youre free feel way take exception manners never
hurt i personally disagree feel her generalizations were fine
i have right think say too alis under 
compunction change single word now while youre free 
disagree every word she wrote tear apart her character 
uncalled im posting form public reprimand you
tear down alis integrity character publicly youll get chastised
publicly return would have been so hard say ali please
 bit more specific your description way ive read 
indicates youre stating my view also thats simply true
id really like see disclaimer noting you dont mean 
entire internet entire rsh group attached despite
your intent list names bottom thanks cordially 
always c calling her moron asshole just reduces 
weight your words opinions author eyes 
myself possibly others 

oh ali nice see someone standing up something even 
its something i personally advocate
