mg i went buying simms recently sales person told me 

mg chip simms chip simms one cannot use them interchan
mg you use one you have use all same type

dont believe everything you told i can tell you mixing them 
between banks ok i cant see why mixing one bank unless 
 different speeds eg mixing ns ns simms one 
bank two only differ type chips uses assuming 
 simms mx bit wide here two equivalent 
configuration chip simm uses two bit wide mbit m bit 
nibbles one bit wide mbit chip total bit wide mbyte 
 bit simm uses nine bit wide mbit chips equivalent 
because way pinned simm board simm 
interface both act bit wide mbyte simms sorry 
 too techie ya


mg similarly one cannot plug two mb simms one mb simms 
gi
mg system total meg why so my system supports
mg meg has simm slots can i plug mb simms give my
mg mb 

 sounds correct problem your computer takes bit 
wide simms you can mix different sizes one bank why you ask 
simple you understand why banks assuming you have bit 
cpu dx data bus eg mechanism retrieve data 
from memory bits wide so computer expects see bits when 
 asks data get bandwidth bit wide motherboard 
links mx one bit data parity so i ignore 
 simple explaination get bits bits means 
 simm bank stores only bit wide data you 
have bit bus two mx simms linked together get bit wide 
data which reason why banks simms wide bit banks 
 simms wide your computer required mx eg bit wide data 
 parity bits used some pss asts you could upgrade 
one simm time

hope message over your head answer your 
question simple i could just said because i said so
