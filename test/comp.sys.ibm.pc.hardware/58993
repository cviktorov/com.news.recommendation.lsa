so going mailorder through gateway i save plus i get
technical support over phone free software package

have fun trying get hold technical support over phone least
locally you can walk right up dealer tell him what wrong 
he has fix 
 
how long does he have take fixing does he have use new
parts when he repairs can he substitute used parts without your
knowledge can he charge you repairs should under warranty
 he claims due improper maintenance your part 

when comes local dealers

 have fun getting consistently good support most techs 
retreaded salesmen trained technicians high turnover rate

 have fun getting inwarranty work done quickly courteously

 have fun getting outofwarranty work done cheaply even done
period unless you paid service contract

having been both service technician service manager 
computerland franchise another retail computer place i know what
im talking about 

i also know local service scam retail computer dealers like
 push when theyre selling its same old song car dealers
having been singing years buy from me youll get good
service we always treat our customers right buy from my competition
 youll sorry you need service 

experienced mail order buyers know some mail order
companies give excellent service including overnight replacement parts 
onsite calls etc probably some local dealers can give you
good service too you think all local dealers give consistenly good 
service you wrong i have many anectdotes prove my point 
 im sure others net can do better job than i can
