 you shouldnt have troubles i have heard machines having problems 
 slower than recommended memory speeds never faster 
 
 
 should run without any trouble course why do you want buy some
 ns mixed them ns ns more expensive than ns 
 furthermore your machine run slowest simms clock speed eventhough
 you have ns just my cents thought
 


your machine run whatever bus jumpered tocmos set 
usually wait states regardless what speed ram installed 
motherboard can sense speed ram installed unless you call
failing sort autosense how you can sometimes use
slower ram machine you either set number wait states 
accomodate slow ram which case all memory run 
slower rate you reduce wait states take chance 
slower ram act like faster ram you wont crash

putting faster ram wont speed things up unless you tell machine
 has faster ram 

mixing fast slow ram help you you have keep bus 
slowed down accomodate slow ram
