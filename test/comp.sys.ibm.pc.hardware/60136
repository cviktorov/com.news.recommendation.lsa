 looks like everything works advertised i am disappointed
 speed im using intel internal k modem pc
 telebit k unix end which currently limited 
 kbits unix com link get quantitative comparison i
 did cat file where file kbyte uncompressed ascii text 
 took seconds scroll through x window over modem link
 charssec using identical hardware procommfw same
 cat file takes seconds charssec btw i use ncd pc xview
 my pc work hp every day same unix access from pc over
 lan like just fine same cat file scrolls 
 seconds lan connection

i just tried few experiments i catd byte file lines
under various scenarios

pcxview dos fullscreen os window xx sec
telix dos os window xsx sec
telix dos fullscreen os window standard vga sec
telix dos windows window xx sec
uwwin seamless os window xx gave up after min
uwwin windows xx faster gave up after min
uwwin seamless os window using pg sec could have been 
 little faster i had keep
 hitting space bar

i using ati wonder xl video card way

so pcxview dos looks pretty good linebyline scrolling
 os desktop looks pathetic although fullpage redraws pretty
good

i tried under pcxview using my normal xbold x font
 very small font difference times
 modem receive light pretty solidly so looks like 
bottleneck baud modem screen drawing
