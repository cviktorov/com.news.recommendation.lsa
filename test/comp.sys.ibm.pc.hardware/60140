 hi fellow netters
 
 i have question you i am gonna buy dx mhz
 vesa localbus speed benefit great 
 would wise spend localbus system hd controller 
 graphic card normal use i mean i wont use 
 server 
 
 also i read article from someone sorry i cant remember your
 name he said even though you have localbus harddisk
 controller your performances wont much greater because
 disks throughtput 
 so what use having fast bus peripherals cant 
 cope 

something bear mind what v vlb stands 

v video origional intention bus speed up
 bus so large memory memory transfers would faster
 espically useful transfering data from main memory 
video memory

since usually vlb slots card makers have been making 
cards fit other two 

how about vlb ethernet card move data card 
 odd mbs wait tickle onto net 
just over mbs

 do do however free local bus other cards 

some times you need fast busses sometimes you dont

 
 thank you
