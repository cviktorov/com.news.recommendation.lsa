hi
i have orchid fahrenheit vlb mb dram s
c based card i had problem while after installing my
second meg dram video thanks orchid i got fix
from tech support jumper settings given 
ordinary manual i assume would come memory ordered from
them so i guess i should glad didnt just say buy memory
from us something like 

 one thing i puzzled why 
xxk color mode thing either full screen 
enlarged desktop mode my ati ultra plus can handle given mb
 memory all mb buys you fahrenheit xx
just one more mode geez had i known i wouldnt have bothered i
asked them why all i got your point well taken 
orchids software developers busy other projects

so get point finally any s c
drivers out can handle high res hicolor modes id love 
get another card perhaps have wait until next
generation cards comes out since card came bundled my
system its so easy exchange things unless theyre
broken

 you want modes steer away from orchids s c
cards ie vlb vavlb least until developers less
busy magazines believed ive only seen one s c
product thus far which can handle xxk color genoa
although evenn might misprint

please generic semigeneric drivers out
 let me know where i can get them xxk ok i
coulda gotten my ati vga wonder xl

thanks
