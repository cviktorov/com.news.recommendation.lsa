ive just installed new colorado jumbo tape backup unit from
gateway i have couple complaints i dont know how
common serious problems may i would appreciate some
feedback from others who have used system btw 
dxv tower system

i have similar configuration colorado mb dx tower

 problems 

 ofirstly gateway shipped me only mb tapes even though 
drive mb unit when i called complain only
said thats all we carry compression you can
fit mb one tape maybe so why did i pay
extra large capacity tape drive

you got suckered same way i did silly me believing
 logo front meant actual carrying capacity
 people who do sort thing living call 
marketing lawyers who prosecute call fraud
perhaps we can have bunch other duped buyers march 
 corporate headquarters

 oi have about mb data my c drive i choose 
spaceoptimizing compression scheme started full backup
 software estimated would take about minutes 
took hours does sound about right

 bit long my system takes about minutes do 
 same thing usually hours particularly tape 
 grinding away whole time means your block size 
 write too small any way change block 
size write buffer size so its bigger

 oduring backup about dozen files came up access
denied errors most were cwindowssystem
commdrv keyboarddrv shelldll etc also
cwindowsprogmanexe couple files ctape
directory anyone else had happen

 because files opened dos files 
tape directory likely executable file configuration
file tape system i would recommend running backup
from dos so make complete backup tape directory

thanks any all feedback system id also appreciate
hearing good sources blank tape cartridges preferably mb
size

 mb cartridges wont do you any good since drive
wont write mb physical data tape 

thanks
