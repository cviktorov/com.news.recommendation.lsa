 what exactly do numbers mean ie which mb ns
 
 numbers refers nanoseconds could someone explain
 exactly what numbers means time spent bettwen processors request
 answer retrieved case reading 
 
 means time required memory refresh ie x
 needs ns before ready read again

nope its time taken read data from memory its read time
 memory still have refreshed whole phase called
 cycle cycle time being about twice access time

im sorry im misunderstanding your post dram does have 
 refreshed each access cycle so cycle time does have 
twice access time because refresh phase

 access time usually means delay time from falling edge raw
address strobe ras data bus driven

dram access cycle timing chart can roughly shown following some
signals intentionally omitted

addr racaraca raraw address cacolumn address
ras high low floating
cas driven either h l
data validvalid
 
 
 cycle time
 access time ras access time

yes cycle time more than twice access time 
because refresh phase refresh can done either 
trailing phase normal access cycle individual cycle
