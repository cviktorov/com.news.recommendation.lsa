what does meg megssec scsi drive cost
since quadra only mac able deal mbs hard drives start
 mb i have idea
 mac i have following all external
 mb mb
 mb mb
 mb mb
mb mb
mb mb
mb mb
mb mb
etc

so scsiscsi mac goes down pricemb hard drive size goes
up i assume same pc world

i wont argue scsi standard makes good well implimented
data highway i still want know why intrinsically better
than ide isa bus when comes multitasking oss when
managing data from single scsi hard drive
well scsi also floppy drive interface mac since scsi 
inteface any noncard nonmodem notkeyboard device id used
 floppy drive called cpu all identifiers allows cross
drive interfacing fast os program cpu scsi drive can handle 
itthis shows up best quatra line
 ibm uses scsi floppy drive should happen well
also scsi just drives printers scanners expandsion cards 
 showed up plus nubus cage cdrom etc
ide seems mainly hard drives specs nobody has given me any
 i cant find any besides advertizments call ide interface
make what you 
scsi jack all trades ide master one
 alone puts scsi above ide scsi blows ide out water
remember scsi used high priced machines until about months ago
when mac prices came down earth so rule scale still played
 scsi remained high costcheap seems mean chezzy high end
computer world times more than anything else proably kept scsi
off statosphere price wise
scsi came from high end computer world multitasking os were 
standard most part all interface next could have used 
choose scsi bit bit mode scsi multitasking os desined
interface while ide bit scsi braindead run one program interfaces
 least way mac use bit scsiugh
