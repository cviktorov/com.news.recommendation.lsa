depends what youd like your joystick ive seen gravis
joysticks radio shack seemed flimsy didnt fit well my
hand i have heard csipgames dont last well less than
 year flightsims one redeeming feature does seem ability
 adjust tension stick

i recently purchased ch flightstick arent any suction cups 
 tension adjusters otherwise seems excellent joystick 
im currently using wing commander series red baron works
quite well large base does require steadying hand so
leaves free buttons provide good tactile response you can hear
 feel them well other models made ch can go up 
down features

 price comparison gravis analogue joysticks sell here
compared i paid ch flightstick i think extra
 worth just feel best thing do ask salesperson
 let you try them out least feel before you buy

just another note analogue joysticks best flightsims something
 needs sensitive touch youre only playing games castle
wolfenstein some other game only uses digital input ie only up
down left etc instead how much right you might want look 
 gravis gamepad look like nintendo control pad i dont know
much beyond
