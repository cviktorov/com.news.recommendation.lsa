 scsi adapter work various hardware software
packages based upon my experiences adaptec 
controller hopefully help others however note i
cannot guarantee following really help you works

 windows enhanced mode

 windows install program should automatically configure dos
 windows use adaptec however just case
something went wrong im going describe some changes needed
 get windows working also you may have noticed
 installing windows makes your pc run much slower even when
youre running windows methods speeding up discussed 
 section called windows runs slowly


 msdos configuration

 windows install program adds smartdrive disk cache your
configsys autoexecbat files you follow instructions
youll notice youll need use doublebuffering smartdrive
 default setup youll also notice your system runs
much much slower both windows msdos see section
called windows runs slowly some ways speeding your system
up


 windows configuration

 get adaptec work windows make sure 
enh section systemini file contains entry

virtualhdirqoff

i believe windows install program automatically adds entry
 systemini im sure doesnt work you you
might want try adding some more lines

virtualhdirqoff
systemrombreakpointfalse
emmexcludeacfff

you probably dont need above lines though 
systemrombreakpoint entry used enable support memory
managers like qemmmax only needed you use programs


 windows runs slowly

 once you do get windows running chances 
your system running much slower than before its its
probably because

 you happen using aspidossys version your
configsys file congratulations appears 
winning solution

 you very lucky whether your luck hold out remains 
 seen 

 your system running much slower than before almost
definitely caused smartdrive doublebuffering according 
windows documentation microsoft technical note q
smartdrive double buffering required aspidossys you must use
smartdrive doublebuffering enabled while works really
slows down your pc i once estimated slowed my pc down 
factor five i consider unacceptable i looked other
solutions

 unfortunately you cannot just disable doublebuffering you
do windows enhanced mode work you might even
destroy contents your hard disk trying run windows 
what you can do one following

 use other drivers provide doublebuffering my
opinion unbelievable slowness smartdrive caused
either horribly inefficient doublebuffering bug 
smartdrive

 use driver provides vds services vds stands 
virtual dma services standard which supported
 windows allows busmastering disk controllers like
 work windows

 after trashing my hard disk countless times i found following
solutions none which require using smartdrive note however i
am now getting occasional parity errors which probably caused
 solutions might see below while following
does require smartdrive using some kind disk cache utility 
strongly recommended makes windows run much much faster

 you do have aspidossys driver you do need aspi
 functions controlling cdrom tape drive more than two
 physical hard disks etc you can add scsihasys driver your
 configsys file eg

drivercscsihasys v

 windows needs v option driver must loaded 
 low memory cannot loaded high memory occupies
 about k november scsihasys driver could 
 obtained from adaptec bbs hopefully its
 still 

 you need aspi functions have aspidossys driver version
 you can use both aspidossys scsihasys drivers
 your configsys file eg

drivercaspidossys
drivercscsihasys v

 amazingly enough scsihasys driver can also loaded high
 assuming you have dos i would have thought would
 crash my system doesnt i asked adaptecs technical support
 about said loading scsihasys high should fine
 long aspidossys loaded low

 my system using scsihasys aspidos would
 occasionally cause windows crash upon restarting exiting
 windows additional result corrupted disk some my
 cwindowsgrp files would corrupted me crashes
 usually occurred while making different program from progmanexe
 default windows shell viceversa reason
 scsihasys may necessary

 i have absolutely idea scsihasys necessary versions 
 aspidos earlier than 

 note many people can use aspidos without
 scsihasys do seem have any problems all i consider
 people lucky others like me have had all sorts problems

 my opinion best necessarily easiest solution 
 upgrade aspidos scsihasys driver longer
 needed unfortunately while you could get previous aspidos
 upgrades from adaptec bbs aspidos driver 
 available from adaptec bbs far i know only
 three ways get copy

 you can buy new november adaptec ez scsi driver
kit which supposedly includes aspidos well other
drivers cdrom drivers i believe list price 
around 

 you already have copy older version aspidos you
can supposedly contact adaptec upgrade ez scsi 
around 

 copy aspidos included central point pc tools 
 msdos note documentation driver stored 
different directories note further only aspidos 
included cdrom drivers drivers support more than two
hard disks included where i obtained my copy
 aspidos 

note however i am now getting occasional parity errors 
windows all probability defective hardware my pc causing
 i upgraded my motherboard just after i found above
solutions however because parity errors occur only during disk
accesses very small definite possibility 
parity errors driverrelated example changing bus onoff
timing certain disk transfers might cause ive run various
memory tests hours time tests have found 
problems problem probably caused memory marginal
timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers
 why memory tests didnt find any problems problems
show up only under disk io however im mentioning just case
 isnt hardware problem


 floppycontrollerbased tape backup devices

 two possible problems using adaptec 
floppycontrollerbased tape backup device colorado memory
systems jumbo 

 tape backupsrestores can take very long time tape drive
 constantly starts stops starts stops etc

 tape operations may erratic encounter too many tape errors
 problem might caused defective hardware my 
 however ive heard other people having similar problems so
 im mentioning just case hardware problem my
 


 tape backupsrestores take long time

 you have floppycontrollerbased tape backup device you may
have adjust adaptec bus onoff timing best
results when using tape drive normally while doing tape backup
 restore tape drive motor should continuously running 
only occasional pause however default bus timing 
adaptec may cause tape drive motor start stop
start stop every few seconds causes needless wear 
tape tape drive however note dirty tape head defective
tape drive can also cause make sure your tape heads clean
 also causes tape backup restore take much much longer
than necessary

 problem here tape backups use floppy dma 
transfer data memory tofrom tape drive adaptec uses dma
 transfer data memory tofrom hard disk floppy dma needs
 feed data tape drive certain rate tape drive 
 fed data quickly enough floppy dma tape drive stops
rewinds bit restarts once enough data eventually fed 
 default bus timing adaptec which really dma timing 
too large example when backup done data has 
transferred from hard disk memory from memory 
tape because default timing adaptec hogs memory too
much too much time spent transferring data from hard disk 
memory enough time spent transferring data from memory 
tape drive result tape drive constantly starts stops
because data fed quickly enough

 solution change adaptecs bus onoff timing 
default factory setting microseconds microseconds off
 bus timing needs lowered microseconds can
 done one two ways

 you have aspidos you can use n option example i use
 bus timing microseconds which means i use 
 following line my configsys file

devicecaspidossys n

 note space between n 

 you dont have aspidos your only recourse try find 
 program called setscsiexe which very difficult find 
 reason adaptec reasons own does seem 
 want widely distributed i once asked someone who worked 
 adaptec asked me upload anywhere you have
 anonymous ftp access internet you could try using archie 
 hunt down copy i believe couple sites have
 you do find copy you run like so

setscsi n

 adjusts bus timing microseconds running
 setscsiexe without any arguments resets bus timing back 
 factory defaults

 note seems you cannot use setscsiexe you use
 aspidos setscsiexe crashed my system aspidos loaded i
 could use setscsiexe scsihasys however

do lower bus timing below microseconds increase 
above microseconds you lower too low hard disk
throughput suddenly drop your system feel slower me 
microseconds works fine value may work fine you you may
have adjust downwards little

 once youve lowered bus timing tape backups restores
should run faster

 also do experiment bus onoff times other
options i have intentionally described unless you know what
you doing bad combinations can cause parity errors worse 
starving memory refresh

 program called bustifixexe exists adaptec bbs unless
 has been upgraded since i last checked which has been while
 selfextracting archive containing batch file couple
 other files batch file supposed allow one set 
bus onoff times others however when i tried
running program my my system crashed time i
 running scsihasys i didnt check see 
conflict maybe old program works only b
although docs say works 


 erratic tape operations too many tape errors

 problem may may exist although existed my
system hardware problem just my particular could cause 
however ive heard other people having similar problems so im
mentioning just case isnt hardware problem just my


 symptoms problem which persists even after cleaning 
tape head

 backing up tape encounters unusable sector detected errors
 resulting aborted tape backup

 tape backup works tape compare fails

 tape drive starts stops starts stops etc much too often
 unlike abovementioned problem tape backupsrestores take 
 long time where tape drive starts stops every few seconds
 kind startingstopping occurs every few seconds so

 fastback plus does findsee any tape backup devices other
 programs like central point backup cms jumbo software
 assuming you have cms jumbo tape drive can findsee 
 tape drive fastback plus cannot

 too many tape read errors

 although i do know what causing problem i discovered
 using different floppy controller solves few months ago i
upgraded my motherboard which contained integrated floppy
controller i already had floppy controller i
initially disabled motherboard floppy controller after while i
decided try disabling floppy controller using one 
 motherboard when i did tape drive cms jumbo 
reliability increased dramatically fastback plus suddenly
able find use tape drive

 i dont know caused hardware problem my 
 one hand floppy drives worked great when were attached
 which seems say nothing wrong 
 other hand tape drive didnt work well attached 
 floppy controller did work when attached different
controller could indication hardware problem my
 i did change floppy drive cables so conceivable 
 problem cables i dont know what cause really 
however youre having similar problems you might want consider
trying new floppy controller


 sound cards

 many popular sound cards can play record digitized sound 
 typically done using dma like tape drive dma 
adaptecs dma can conflict sound card dma unlike 
tape dma conflict usually manifests itself parity error
your system crashes parity error message what happens 
 data being transferred so quickly sound card 
adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes 
parity error usually getting parity error means 
hardware problem your system case however parity
error symptom bad hardware

 ive found parity errors typically occur while recording
digitized sound chances errors increase you increase
 recording fidelity eg higher sampling rate recording stereo
recording using bits instead etc

 like tape drive solution solution here lower 
adaptecs bus timing see section tape drives 
information how done note however may may
 solve problem may only reduce probability parity
error software used record digitized sound can greatly affect
 problem ie some software inefficient disk caches 
speed your hard disk amount disk fragmentation can also
affect 


 miscellaneous info

 section contains miscellaneous hints tips rumors much
 merely information ive heard read about have 
verified i believe following information correct im
 sure use your own risk

 qemm you need specify db
 parameter eg db unless you using aspidos driver
 you dont qemm crashhang bootup although qemm
 manual mentions install program does seem detect 
 present automatically add option qemm
 command line least occurred qemm install
 program i havent tested any other version earlier versions 
 qemm probably need parameter im sure ive never used 
 version earlier than 

 you use aspidos you do need give qemm db parameter

 some all versions do support hard disks over one
 gigabyte size support hard disks capacities over gb you
 need get new rom bios from adaptec im sure 
 still true latest bs being sold adaptec

 connect cdrom drive you need scsi cdrom drive 
 some drivers note some cdrom drives have proprietary interfaces
 nonscsi drives cannot used you have three
 choices cdrom drivers i have idea how well following
 solutions work even work following secondhand
 information

 you can buy adaptecs ez scsi driver package which lists 
something like you already have older adaptec drivers
you can supposedly upgrade ez scsi around contact
adaptec details ez scsi package supposedly contains
everything you need

 you can buy corelscsi driver package which made 
same people make coreldraw package contains cdrom
drivers scsi tape drivers worm drivers etc i do know
 list price ive seen package sold around
 note corelscsi does come aspidos
driver which needed you do already have aspidos
you may better off getting adaptecs ez scsi instead

 method obsolete following drivers have been
obsoleted adaptecs ez scsi kit im mentioning 
case someone already has drivers you can use 
drivers adaptec asw kit aspidos asw
kit aspi cdrom drivers you have get copy 
mscdexexe highlevel cdrom driver included 
 asw kit available from several bulletin
boards

 use scsi tape drive you need software knows
 how talk scsi tape drive software ive heard about 
 again like above section cdrom drives i have idea how
 well following solutions work even work 
 following secondhand information

 central point pc tools msdos supposedly supports large
number scsi tape drives comes scsi drivers
aspidos well central point backup

 corelscsi driver package contains scsi tape backup
program see above section cdrom drives more
details however note corelscsi does come 
requires aspidos

 ive seen advertisements sell three configurations

 scsi controller hard disk rom bios
 scsi controller wbios adaptec aspi drivers
 scsi controller wbios adaptec aspi drivers 
corelscsi driversprograms

 i imagine adaptec now sells fourth configuration

 scsi controller wbios ez scsi drivers including aspi
drivers

 those people who use unix might interested version gnu tar
 msdos talks scsi tape drive via aspidos driver you
 need driver before you can use program ive never used
 version gnu tar ive heard works i dont know
 how well though you have anonymous ftp access internet
 copy can found wsmrsimtelarmymil mirror sites

pdmsdosdskutl
aspibinzip gnu tar scsi tape drives adaptec xx
aspipatzip patches aspibin relative gnu tar 
aspisrczip src gnu tar scsi tape adaptec ctrlr

 i have idea copy can found compuserve unixforum might
 have any forum does

 far msdos concerned b controllers 
 same msdos should work well b
 however hardware two boards identical 
 least one nonmsdos program initially did work
 did work b bsd version 
 bsd unix

 case anyones curious heres edited copy my configsys file

 however i used floppycontrollerbased tape drive i
 planned record highquality sound from sound card i would still
 need some way changing adaptecs bus onoff times first
