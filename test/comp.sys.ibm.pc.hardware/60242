basically im looking svga x noninterlaced
monitor nec fg one most computer mags use 
 standard from what ive seen heard looks pretty
good its bit expensive bucks best deal ive seen
so i thought perhaps i might find something good less any
recommendations i also thought about nec fgx which has 
same specs fg except scan frequency which more
limited anybody have any comments one would work 

i believe nec replacing fg fgx fge fge
models reportedly being released end month im
waiting fge main difference being year warranty 
higher refresh rates higher resolutions sounded from pc
magazine note fge being boosted number ways
call nec number have them send you info

i have been using nec fgx several months now several others here 
also have monitor we have had problems personally i would spend 
extra money monitor sacrifice other features pc 
mhz viz mhz based comments others you might want view 
fgx vs series pc running windows x refresh rate 
appears ok me you might feel differently finally speaking 
spending money size todays files etc tape backup 
certainly worth recently i set up friends pc mhz vesa 
local bus redraw time graphics program only factor 
faster which i doubt warrants extra cost
