scsii ranges from mbs
scsiii ranges from mbs
ide ranges from mbs 
esdi always mbs although some nonstandard versions
 above does tell proper story scsi
scsii bit asynchronous mbs ave synchronous mbs max transfer 
base
scsifaster requires scsi controller chip provides
 scsi bit bit speeds scsi controlers
scsi mbs mbs burstbit mbs mbs burst bit 
 mbs mbs burstbitwide fast bit scsi can 
wide fast depends how port designedthe quadras support
fast scsi wide when os scsi manager rewritten since 
quardas use scsi nonwide port

 article pc mag talking about scsi scsi uses
ten devices native mode outside its native mode behaves 
lot like scsi devices slower through put

from your own figures scsi indeed twice esdi article pointed out
 faster ide seems bit scsi using scsi 
contoler chip mac quadra uses scsi controler chip its scsi
 gets mbs through put asynchronous bit scsi far excess 
normal synchronous scsi output which near
 burst scsi machine scsi controller chip

 pc world seems have scsi scsi mixed up fact scsi 
controler chips allow near scsi speeds through scsi device
 shown mac quadra which skews some data scsi vs
ide esdi test i agree article could have stated 
faster ide came off scsi device scsi chip maybe 
 editor killed because article dealing 
scsi scsi he did understand effect scsi device
 scsi controller chip
scsi chips limited mb max scsi devices scsi chips
becoming common produce up mbs bit mode mbs bit
mode fast version scsi ports cannot use wide scsi cource
 prime piece wierdness scsi devices have scsi chips
 more accurately machine does allows best both
worlds high scsi speeds cheeper scsi costs full scsi hardware
port electronic controller etc very expensive also creates
 logistic nightmare how fast scsi goes

when one knows facts behind numbers one realizes 
article knows what talking about even does tell how 
figures came about while dxbpsuvmpsuedu throwing out
ranges dont tell squat since he ignores scsi devices 
scsi chips his ranges tell even less intended
