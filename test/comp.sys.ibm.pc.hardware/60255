 what current products available upgrade resolution
 which ones support postscript
 
 any experiences them either good bad
 
 quality difference really noticable
 
 im planning producing camera ready copy homes higher
 resolution noticed 
 
 you talking about laser jet i believe has postscript
i dont see any advantage using pcl when you have peice hardware
plugged lj doing work can support any language
 suited job besides i dont think pcl even capable 
handling dpi specifications i only have experience laser
master winjet which brings lj up dpi uses postscript
 also has fast print mode which postscript lower
resolution dpi i think fast particular product
uses your host processor process postscript so even decent
pc you know its going slow ie slow compared highend workstation
processed ps

 quality difference very noticable almost worth wait 
 ps processing im rather impatient

we were using bw camera images rs gray scale image 
accepted ms word handed winjet ps printer driver which converts
 image postscript hands off winjets postscript
processor postscript rendered ram lots when 
 done shoots directly printer ps processor can also
accept ps files created from other sources including dos applications 
windows has running time printing ps processor 
responsible halftoning id say does pretty good job our
camera images came out very good my opinion good laser masters
demo though

i dont know how many other similar products out i would 
surprised several
