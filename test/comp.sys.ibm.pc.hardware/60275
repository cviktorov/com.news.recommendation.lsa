i just purchased viewsonic orchid p short i am happy
 monitor unhappy card i have spent lot more time
futzing card so what i am going write about monitor
 pretty moires i had under simcity my magnavox went away 
isnt heavy i thought would lbs i think so much 
monitor bitch session test results

 going modern trend orchid p card only supports colors
 x mode without driver course breaks any dos program
which uses svga modes like most my cdroms compudyne whiplash vga
orchid fahrenheit orchid f vlb all share limitation those
 all s cards which means s problem them p uses
 weitek vga chip which also doesnt support them hercules graphite
card does seem have modes i didnt run same test cases 
i did other boards during brief time i had able 
print splash screen groliers encyclopedia though which s
cards just printed hash which why i suspect svga modes supported

 supported resolutions really annoy me you can do x hz 
you tell driver you have nec fg only have about six monitors
listed plus generic you choose generic you cant get any high
refreshes all x you limited hz seems me
 hardware should able support bandwidth can do hz
 sure should able do higher vertical resolution
 main reason i bought card over orchid f vlb i currently have
 do xx hz well

 higher graphics modes all crash hp dashboard i just got off phone
 orchid drivers i dont know what i have he unable
 recreate problem plus side tech rep helpful 
he could booted up program his computer verify he didnt have
 problem he didnt know why limited refresh hz either

 board faster ofvlb most things according hercules
speedy program program tests various operations reports results
 pixelssecond i dont have numbers graphite card 
were close half ofvlb ie slower running mhz
 isa so numbers arent really comparable following numbers
were all obtained using mhz air motherboard umc chipset 
 mb memory i give ranges because program reports numbers 
computes them tend jump around bit


k means thousand m means million pixels per second

dib screen k k k k
memory screen m m m m
screen screen m m m m
vector solid m m m
vector styled k k k k
polygon shaded m m m m
polygon hatched m m m m
ternary rops m m k k
font k k k k m

 dib screen test takes device independent bitmap face transfers
 screen i have idea what being done internally far 
conversions go memory screen takes same face copies 
 screen my guess after has been rasterized bitmap can
just copied video display screen screen test copies 
face from place place screen awesome interestingly solid
vectors shaded polygons show improvement hatched polygons ie
filled crosshatching ternary rops whatever graphics
operations like xors maybe dead loss i give two
numbers fonts because i think caching
when fonts first drawn screen done fairly slowly 
 speed ofvlb speed increases dramatically sounds
like programming benchmark me

i make claims numbers mean anything all its just what
i saw when i ran them my computer i normally dont write disclaimers
 time maybe id better my testing totally unconnected my
work i program under unix decstations done completely without 
knowledge blessing equipment my company
