 pc magazine april although scsi twice fasst esdi
 faster than ide support up devices its acceptance has
long been stalled incompatability problems installation headaches

i love when magazine writers make stupid statements like re
performance where do get those numbers ill list actual
performance ranges which should convince anyone 
statement absurd
scsii ranges from mbs
scsiii ranges from mbs
ide ranges from mbs
esdi always mbs although some nonstandard versions

 your own data although scsi twice fast esdi correct

how twice do you just pick whatever scsi setup makes
 statment correct
even you could make statement would meaningless unless
you understood esdi ide i include scsi ata 
completely different esdi devicelevel like mfmrll


 scsi controller chip scsi can reach mbs which indeed
 faster than ide all scsi facts have been

great you can compare two numbers ata has several speed modes 
way what article said misleadingwrong

posted newsgroup my mac ibm info sheet available ftp 
sumexaimstanfordedu infomacreport 
macibmcompareversion txt should may still 

i would recommend people call ncr board download ansi specs
 really interested stuff


part problem both mac ibm pc inconsiant about what scsi
 which though well documented quadra has scsi chip
 apple salesperson said uses fast scsi chip mbs
mbs burst does scsi mbs maximum synchronous quadra
uses ansynchronous scsi which slower seems mac ibm see

something missing anyway i agree theres lot 
opportunity marketing jingo like scsi compliant which tells
you nothing about performance whether has wide support etc

one reference quadras scsi controller chip 
digital review oct v n p

what does use hopefully good ncr chip eg c
