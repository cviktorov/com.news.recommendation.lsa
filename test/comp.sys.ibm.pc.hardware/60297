scsi better because has better future has lot 
minor advantages right now ide cards cheaper right now 
 obsolete few years fact ide cards so cheap 
might well free real cost ide drives scsi
cards cost more worth 


i almost got hernia laughing one

youll probably get one when you realize your vesa super
dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks

 anything scsi pc obsolete killed off vesa local
 any luck pc bus archeitecture doen any sbus

have you ever seen what happens when you hook busmaster controller 
 vesa local bus actually slows down your system
bus ide must real nice get shafted bucks 
extra cost scsi drive pay another scsi controller

maybe my workstation doesnt understand what your vesa local bus
ide 

vesa local bus killed off pcmi whatever intels spec 
vlbus good much more than vga cards

 each his own ill laugh when you start crying over how much you
spent your little ide drives finding out you need more
space

 biggest advantage scsi right now you can add more
different kinds devices tapes etc easily can add
bigger disks best most cost effective hard disks available
 scsi

here here



only you need drives larger meg oh yes gotta have megssec
transfer rate those speedy tape backups cd rom drives

dont stick your foot your mouth when you make statement you know
nothing about


id rather wait second compared minutes ide would take
obviously exaggerated

have you ever tried backup gigs disk oh i forgot you cant
because you have ide one makes ide disks big


basically person has ask which one better himher
 probably never see expensive benefits from scsi

i guess you probably bought sx too


also all armwaving about scsi expandability moot point 
 user only has one two drives scsi those two
drives may fast speed only due onboard memory
cache something i can duplicate caching ide controller

what scsi fastwide spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid
vlbus ide crap

stop thread now its just cluttering up bandwidth you want
 read about scsi vs ide just pay visit you local usenet archive

 best scsi fastwideetc clearly faster than any best ide drive
all response given based upon personal experience 
drives you cant judge completely different interfaces 
ide has low cost adavantage descent performance
scsi has ability super high capacity expandibility speed

neither one better all cases

 you dont belive what i said about busmastering vlbus pick
up back issue pcweek whihc tested vlbus eisa isa
busmastering cards

send flames devnull
