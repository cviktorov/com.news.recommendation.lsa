when i changed my motherboard i had lot trouble getting
ledspkrturboturboswitchhddklckrst connectors correctly
reconnected example turbo switch had three wires 
 motherboard connection only two pins so 

does anyone know solution do i need rewire 
connectors what best way approach 
 somewhat frustrating i got work somehow my turbo
switch doesnt work all


i just put replaced motherboard system had similar questions
my cents worth

 speaker connector should have two wires going speaker 
 speaker being coil its bidirectional makes difference
which way you attach

turbo switch three wires control how you want turbo
 become active switch pushed switch out i think
 middle wire common use ohm meter figure out which wire
connects common wire when switch pushed which two
wires connected when switch out place appropriate
two wires turbo berg connector motherboard

leds turbo hd leds uni directional depending which
way wires attached led light my ami motherboard
 turbo switch wires attached berg connector 
board board power up default turbo mode your motherboard
 like just attace led wires board led doesnt
light power off reverse connectors try again should work

 does attach turbo switch board

hope helps
