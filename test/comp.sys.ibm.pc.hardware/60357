 point view why does scsi have advantage when comes multi
 tasking data data could anywhere drive can
 scsi find faster can get off drive computer
 faster does have better cache system i thought scsi good 
 managing data bus when multiple devices attached we 
 only talking about single drive explain why scsi inherently
 faster managing data from hard drive

 ide integrated device electronics 
 currently most common standard mainly used medium sized 
 drives can have more than one hard drive asynchronous transfer mbs max

 why dont you start specsheet isa bus first
 you can quote scsi specs till youre blue face 
 exceed isa bus capability whats point

who said isa necessary eisa vlb only interfaces worth
investing thousands dollars eg new pcs worth money 

 who says ide limited megssec what about vlbide does anyone
 know how perform

you didnt read carefully vlbide uses same connection mechanism
 standard ide transfer rate limited ide whether its
interfaced isa eisa vlb matters 

 so its lowest setting scsi interface asynchronous scsi mode averages 
 through put maximum ide asynchronous mode full scsi mode
 blows poor ide out window down street garbage can
 implimented what system 

 mine one thing scsi blows ide out water hands down 
ide has better throughput why isnt used workstations file
servers 

 problem becomes can drive mechanisim keep up those through put
 rates where bottleneck cost scsi comes from 
 interface itself more more from drive mechanisims use 
 scsi through put 

 given original question scsi used only single hard drive
 controller necessary get scsi drive do
 least maybe megssec scsi choice make any sence
 what does meg megssec scsi drive cost

 thats nice thing multitasking os scsi can use both drives
 once ive got unix loaded one my pcs along windogs os can only use one two ide drives one time its pretty ugly

i just bought quantum my mac home i paid i
havent seen ide drives cheaper

 original cga cart back i think original ega card
 pga scsi has stood relatively alone coming down
 price mainly because were talking about pcs suns sparc
 sgi name your favorite unix workstation after millions
 pc buying decisions over years scsi has had plenty time 
 come down price

 actually were talking about scsi being expensive simply because
nobody did common interface pc had common read
easily implemented method adding scsi pc like sun 
mac youd find scsi connection medium choice

 i wont argue scsi standard makes good well implimented
 data highway i still want know why intrinsically better
 than ide isa bus when comes multitasking oss when
 managing data from single scsi hard drive

 single drive scsi more expensive you bought your pc 
expandibility so youd want add more drives whatever 
following why i find scsi intrinsically better than ide

 partial list
 you can add many different types devices access them 
concurrently
 scsi device works many different machines i have mac
 pc home moving hard drives between them very nice
 scsi hook them up away go
 scsi devices work together better than ide devices 
instance recently i added older connor meg ide maxtor
 meg ide connor must setup slave 
work other way scsi you set address check 
termination plug away goes
 i have problem ides mutual exclusion i notice 
 time takes switch from accessing drive c drive d 
quite long compared time takes switch from drive c
 d scsi system under multitasking os very
noticable many things can going once

one neat thing ive noticed lately fringe benefit has been 
ability add older almost dead drives storage scsi system 
little problem weve got bunch almost dead meg drives ive
added my pc ive now got interface full does allow me 
have meg drives meg drive tape drive meg drive
all same card 

simply put scsi handier than ide mysterious jumpers figure out
