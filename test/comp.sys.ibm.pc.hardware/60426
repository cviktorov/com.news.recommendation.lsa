 way which multitasking computer actually gives you
more cpu power you had before io overlap
 io overlap your cpu can continue think while disk
operations underway whereas without overlap your cpu sits idly
waiting each disk operation finish disk operations take
 eternity compared fast cpu

so when youve got multitasking you want increase performance 
increasing amount overlapping you do

one way dma bus mastering either make 
possible io devices move data out memory
without interrupting cpu alternative cpu move
 data several scsi interface cards allow dma 
bus mastering ide however defined standard interface
created ibm pc which requires cpu move all data
bytes dma
