ive been intently following mag thread while waiting 
mine arrive mail seems lot 
complaints about minor alignment problems mxf one
article contained comment owner called factory
 told his screen rotation within spec 

 figure image rotation would seem little high
 my nec fg specs call greater than mm 

well my monitor arrived last night sure enough has
 very noticable barrel distortion its dramatic 
 especially noticable when image doesnt
fill entire screen fact worse right
side doesnt help matters

what im trying find out minor imperfections
 norm most monitors perfect i dont want
 send back get one same even worse
problem does factory consider kind thing normal
 ship monitors less than perfect alignment 

i cant speak mag innovision far nec concerned 
adjusted factoryspec before leaving central usa distribution point
ma eastern canadian market now heres key nec knows 
 monitors adjustments very sensitive shipping over
distances all bumps rough handling therefore
expect least theory require local distributor
 dealer have adjusted local service centre bull hn
information systems toronto before sale correct 
probably only way having any chance receiving perfect monitor
 definition perfect seems depend how picky one my
case quite 

 other netters just living kind imperfections

i one willing accept what i considered substandard
monitor after two months wrangling direct contact nec
finally received satisfactorily adjusted monitor perfect imho
 major improvement over what dealer distributor were trying
convince me normal short answer dont accept 
imperfections normal because premium one pays 
larger screen monitors one has right expect higher quality 
 youre persistent youll receive
