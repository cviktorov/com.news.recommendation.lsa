hi

i have few enquiries about pcs compatibles general some software
others hardware orientated probably wrong newsgroup everyone 
claims

anyway

 does any one happen have board jumper details trident 
svga graphics card mb even what dip switches do end mine
already works fine albeit slow after having blown up monitor i found 
out which switch controlled interlacenon interlace facility 

 im curious why dip switches card apparantly
little use

 secondly does anyone know why commodore had so crazed design
 pc motherboard respect ram ie k 

 can anyone supply pin details expansion ports pc bit
 even sample circuit cause irq when button pressed
yeah i know its piece cake im lazy 

 software wise anyone care divulge some tips accessing expanded ram
 pc from program written turbo c 

 instance using farcoreleft coreleft return only memory available
from base k regardless combinations emm etc etc
what i want able use ram above beyond mb boundary

im certain whether farmalloc new actually uses anyway ill 
suspect 

 also what half brained wit created dos so reentrant
 follow does anyone have any comments about use dos calls
 c from within dos interrupt ie changing stack size 
 entry use two articles ive read subject have given 
 conflicting views does anyone have any views writing direct 
 screen memory terms portability
