someone group posted little while back were getting 
orchid v card has card arrived what do benchmarks look
like

 one i got only does about kbs text x vgamcga mode
which almost identical other w based cards ati 
does about kbs weird since orchid supposedly should
 much faster i told someone can do almost kbs
since vga chip covered orchid label i cant really tell
 sure uses chip spec sheet comes 
 board docs did say has meg dram uses chip
winmarks about mil slower than viper vs using
standard palette

 btw anyone insterested im trying sell diamond viper megs

 i think its available limited quantites idea what vga
chip uses though

 very careful oem p boards though orchid i got
