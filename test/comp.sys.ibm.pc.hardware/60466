 can anyone explain fairly simple terms why i get os i might 
 need scsi controler rather than ide performance suffer 
 much mb so drive i dont have tape drive cdrom
 any help would appreciated

so when youve got multitasking you want increase performance 
increasing amount overlapping you do

one way dma bus mastering either make 
possible io devices move data out memory
without interrupting cpu alternative cpu move
 data several scsi interface cards allow dma 
bus mastering
 
how do you do busmastering isa bus

ide however defined standard interface
created ibm pc which requires cpu move all data
bytes dma

 were talking isa bus here you can only have dma channel
active any one time presumably transferring data from single device
so even though you can have least devices scsi bus explain how
all those devices can dma transfers through single scsi card
 isaat bus same time

also im still trying track down copy ibms reference book
 from pc technical manual page 

 fdd adapter buffered io bus uses system board
direct memory access dma record data transfers
i expect see something similar pcat hdd adapter 
so lowly lowdensity original pc fdd card used dma pcat
hdd controller doesnt makes real sense
