i have just installed diamond stealth isa card 
 dx system k cache megs memory
 gets about si cpu benchmark rating using
 xx color driver under windows i am getting 
winbench winmarks rating only about million since
i have heard others get million card
i assume something very wrong my setup

what some possible causes card slowing down like 

i ran qualitas asq diagnostic program memory i noted
 following memory timings my machine

asq v qualitas system analysis mon apr am page 
 
access timing 

 hex kb kb access speed ratio 
 start start size time us 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 b 
 c 
 c 
 e 
 f 

note two things chart

 video memory appears many orders magnitude slower than
system memory wait states being inserted here what would
cause 

 ems page frame seems ridiculously slow even though
 being mapped fast xms memory my system through
emm whats going 

note my stealth s video bios ccff being shadowed
through ami bios 

any ideas what might happening here
