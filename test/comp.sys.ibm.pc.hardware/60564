i have maxtor mb isa ide controller although my machine 
dx vlb i has save transfer rate mbs regardless 
 variations isa bus speed i tested speed between
mhz mhz any difference problem 
interface between controller memory

 i also have dx maxtor i have local bus ide controller generic i get
 kbs i tried swapping my local bus ide controller isa ide controller my
 transfer rate went kbs specs drive show maximum platter controller
 transfer rate mbs i dont know how get from here local bus interface
 got me little certainly much i had hoped i am also looking way 

what deal ide transfer rates anybody getting throughput
anywhere close plattercontroller rate i havent seen anything
even close mbsec limit ide interface drives 
noninterleaved arent 

here rates i get

 sequential read msdos c program uses bios calls read sector
 blocks sequentially from outside first track inward

 mhz bus mhz bus
 
 maxtor lxt kbsec kbsec
 quantum lps kbsec kbsec

 disk buffer read same c program rereads same block repeatedly
 so effect reading ram buffer drive

 mhz bus mhz bus
 
 maxtor lxt kbsec kbsec
 quantum lps kbsec kbsec

 coretest v transfer rate seems agree above

 mhz bus mhz bus
 
 maxtor lxt kbsec kbsec
 quantum lps kbsec kbsec

i managed get hold quantum lpsat product manual goes
 excrutiating detail describing how bits get from platter
through controller out ide interface nowhere do i see
anything like after bits whipped platter high speed
 sit around buffer thaw before sent host
even though i swear thats whats happening here some relevent
quotes from manual

 data transferred from disk read buffer rate 
 mbs maximum mbs minimum my calculations show kbsec
 maximum kbsec minimum disk spins rpm 
 sectors per track outside inside

 single burst errors up bits within one sector can corrected
 onthefly real time occur allowing high degree 
 data integrity impact drives performance i take
 mean error correction isnt bottleneck

 pagemode operations datatransfer rate from buffer
 ram up mbs high transfer rate allows interface
 ic communicate over bus datatransfer rate mbs
 while dcs simultaneously controls disktoram transfers
 
so thing can even do its cache prefetch while its sending 
requested sector has kb read buffers prefetching i guess
you could call cache 

so when i do sequential read outer tracks why am i getting 
measly kbsec when i should getting around mbsec

any you harddisk engineers out know


wondering why my disks so slow
