im running linux eisa system im having what i think 
hardware problems could software i dont see why id 
only one having trouble id like some advice how best debug 

 symptom when i try build gcc i get unpredictable unrepeatable
results sometimes o file valid aout format recompiling 
file gives me valid binary sometimes compiler aborts dumps core
 works fine when run again same input compiling same
source files same arguments gives slight differences few
object files note linux unlike many other systems does put
timestamps object files so compiling twice should give bitidentical
results

i also have occasional filesystem corruption my scsi drive 
could caused using development software could also related 
my problems compiling compile problems caused disk
problems i get same results whether i do my work ide scsi
disk

ive set memory speed cache write speed recommended values

i suspect external cache i have real evidence
