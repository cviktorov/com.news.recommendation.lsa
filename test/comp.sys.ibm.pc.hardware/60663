com com port tables programs like most modem programs which 
write directly port work fine anything uses bios call 
fails find bbs ftp site where you can get copy port finder put 
devicepfsys your configsys run pfcom from your autoexecbat 
 little program locate all existing ports make sure bios 
tables updated works great pf also let you swap ports 
 also any value you
