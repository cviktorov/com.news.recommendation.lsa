hello buddy

i do have dd gold experience i just ordered i currently have
dd last version i am very pleased its performance

here my suggestion

 you do have any compression software currently i would go 
dos s compression all discussion net indicates 
 you get compression built os plus other
utilities you would pay way more than besides you 
 now dos whatever means

 you have doubledisk already like i do cost 
 upgrade after thinking about asking net i
decided i could go wrong update cost
i have never suffered from performance dd i have ms hd 
large sw packages both compressed uncompressed format 
works great delays i think better than b 
arguements lot bunk all comparable performance
i am looking forward being able loadhigh dd sw 
has been annoyance

 you have stacker etal currently i would see worth 
effort upgrade

just my 

regards
mark bagdy

i got same mailer about weeks ago i got ddg installed 
documentation my opinion easy follow i used automatic
installation custom everything went smoothly

 were some specific instructions readme file dealing max
 qemm ddg has uninstall unlike dos you need my system has 
mb hard drive before installing ddg i had mb free after ddg i had
mb free pretty good statistics considering my mb permanent windows
swap file stayed uncompressed portion along other drivers 


i have had problems whatsoever i have noticed slowdown other than 
takes little longer boot either windows dos so far i am very
happy camper

i have been using doubledisk gold little more than month 
 dx mhz mb seagate drive running dos windows enhanced
mode
i ran some tests concluded speed doubledisk drive
 drive read cache about equal bare drive without cache
i have complaints about reliability very easy install
 only problem i had castle wolfenstein d i assumed game
 trying bypass dos disk access moved game noncompressed
region disk since game has never given me problem 
 never any damage doubledisk drive
compression performance whole disk has held steady 
around lower than expected about size my files 
 compressed image files some large zip files
