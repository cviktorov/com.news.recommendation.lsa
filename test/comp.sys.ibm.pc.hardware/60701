 going modern trend orchid p card only supports colors
 x mode without driver course breaks any dos program
which uses svga modes like most my cdroms 

 case rom p supports vesa modes up 
x colors vesacompliant applications should have trouble
setting modes im forwarding your posting our software group
just case cant too careful i doubt your applications
 failing run lots stuff depends figuring out which exact svga
theyre looking dont use vesa calls vesa still pretty new
every new chip set confuses them

 supported resolutions really annoy me you can do x hz 
you tell driver you have nec fg only have about six monitors
listed plus generic you choose generic you cant get any high
refreshes all x you limited hz seems me
 hardware should able support bandwidth can do hz
 sure should able do higher vertical resolution
 main reason i bought card over orchid f vlb i currently have
 do xx hz well

i think we go least hz xx maybe more 
its function ramdac speed power we need 
fix problems youve noted were already list 
youre really interested though take look text file
presdat which holds data from which choices 
p monitor installation program built working analogy
you can build up new monitor definition has right
combinations refresh rates your monitors keep backup copy
 file once youve built new version presdat
file run p installation program inst your new choices
should show up assumes you have weitek v drivers
you can tell rev number looking modification time 
 driver version microsoft uses gimmick
too

 board faster ofvlb most things according hercules
speedy program program tests various operations reports results
 pixelssecond i dont have numbers graphite card 
were close half ofvlb ie slower running mhz
 isa so numbers arent really comparable following numbers
were all obtained using mhz air motherboard umc chipset 
 mb memory i give ranges because program reports numbers 
computes them tend jump around bit

 speedy benchmark put out hercules iit who my
knowledge were unencumbered any motivations except making 
hercules graphiteiit agx card look really good so id take 
numbers ton salt texas instruments did same thing
 wintach trying make look good compared 
 anyone cared its safer though safe use
benchmarks from unbiased sources testing labs columnists
etc


interestingly solid
vectors shaded polygons show improvement hatched polygons ie
filled crosshatching ternary rops whatever graphics
operations like xors maybe dead loss 

i think youll large discrepancy between results speedy 
 results anything else universe things

i give two
numbers fonts because i think caching
when fonts first drawn screen done fairly slowly 
 speed ofvlb speed increases dramatically sounds
like programming benchmark me

font caching perfectly legitimate optimization windows has
hooks built right gdi whats kind silly iits
use hardwired quick brown fox jumped over lazy dog 
sat tack string driver only useless 
real applications lacks programming elegance bart
simpson optimization which you save bitmap 
mostrecently drawn string offscreen memory just do 
screentoscreen bitblit you happen given same string 
second time row we call bart simpson optimization
because barts only person we can see benefiting from he
could right i cheat benchmarks hundred times 
done half time would take actually form each character

i make claims numbers mean anything all its just what
i saw when i ran them my computer i normally dont write disclaimers
 time maybe id better my testing totally unconnected my
work i program under unix decstations done completely without 
knowledge blessing equipment my company

we dont have any lawyers theyre all working intel 
used lawyer montana who didnt he died
