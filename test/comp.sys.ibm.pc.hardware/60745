have anybody succeded converting atari monomchrome monitor 
mono vga monitor so please let me know exactly how you did what
graphics card you used
i wish i could help i posted similar question about two weeks ago
i got response all ive asked locally my friendly atari store
i told should possible had idea how
 might done nor did particularly care investigate

please anyone has any suggestions post them


 you might try asking one compsysibm echos best one
may compsysibmpchardware i say because conversion
seems more geared toward pc user wanting use monitor than
 atari user who already can use monitor unless maybe 
want really go wild converting monitor vga 
using vga monitor falcon 

 graphics cards assuming atari monitor can 
modifiedadapted handle vga signals you should probably able
 use any vga card least res around x i havent
tried would my guess

you might want price mono vga monitors anyways may cheaper
 go route than do conversion besides falcon
