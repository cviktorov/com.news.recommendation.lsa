 published regularly compsysibmpchardware



 explicitly warranty
 given settings correct harmless i only collect i do
 check myself always possibility 
settings may destroy your hardware



since i hope however only wellminded people undergo effort 
posting settings chance applicability exists you should
agree disagree some setting let me know immediately order
 update list

 you possess hd mentioned here which you know bios andor
jumper settings please mail them me next update list

only ide atbus harddisks accounted 
 specified landing zone should set equal number 
cylinders specified write precompensation should set
 bioses dont even ask 

another statement maybe right
ide harddisk dont have precomp lzone precomp builtin parameter
 lzone isnt used because most every ide disk has autopark

 jumpers names given printed hds board often only 
jumper number jp means jumper zero means jumper
 left open one means jumper closed
