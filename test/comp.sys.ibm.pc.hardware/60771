 can anyone explain fairly simple terms why i get os i might 
 need scsi controler rather than ide performance suffer 
 much mb so drive i dont have tape drive cdrom
 any help would appreciated
 
 so when youve got multitasking you want increase performance 
 increasing amount overlapping you do
 
 one way dma bus mastering either make 
 possible io devices move data out memory
 without interrupting cpu alternative cpu move
 data several scsi interface cards allow dma 
 bus mastering
 
 how do you do busmastering isa bus
 
 ide however defined standard interface
 created ibm pc which requires cpu move all data
 bytes dma
 
 were talking isa bus here you can only have dma channel
 active any one time presumably transferring data from single device
 so even though you can have least devices scsi bus explain how
 all those devices can dma transfers through single scsi card
 isaat bus same time

think

its scsi card doing dma transfers disks

 scsi card can do dma transfers containing data from any scsi devices
 attached when wants 

 important feature scsi ability detach device frees 
scsi bus other devices typically used multitasking os 
start transfers several devices while each device seeking data 
bus free other commands data transfers when devices 
ready transfer data can aquire bus send data

 ide bus when you start transfer bus busy until disk has seeked
 data transfered typically ms second lock out other
processes wanting bus irrespective transfer time

 
 also im still trying track down copy ibms reference book
 from pc technical manual page 
 
 fdd adapter buffered io bus uses system board
 direct memory access dma record data transfers
 i expect see something similar pcat hdd adapter 
 so lowly lowdensity original pc fdd card used dma pcat
 hdd controller doesnt makes real sense
