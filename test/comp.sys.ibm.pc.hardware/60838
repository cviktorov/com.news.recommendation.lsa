 i am interrested extrodinarily simple concept null modem
 cable actually i have idea so dont count last statement what im
 asking what pins does use what its specifications i just want
 solder one myself instead buying one i dont even know what port 
 used
 
 help me please kekimmellvaxcnsmuskingumedu

 ps im intending use cable pctopc transfers via laplink 
 telix ideas info gladly accepted

i do have specific knowledge laplink telix my recommendation
 any package follow each ones instructions making null
modem cable reason each one may different since isnt
really standard pc pc communications following tutorial
i wrote up give you understanding about rs null modems
 you should still check your software

i eplain couple details rs rs 
 commumications specification communicating between computer 
modem actually can between any end system any communications
hardware terminology used data terminal equipment dte data
communications equipment dce rs spells out voltage levels 
connector type pinouts signal protocols connector 
 db ibm has set alternative standard db primary
signals transmit data td recieve data rd signal ground sg
 other signals provide control between dte dce
 example dte announces powered up ready participate
 communications via data terminal ready dtr signal dtr 
output dte input dce similarly dce announces 
 ready participate communications via data set ready dsr
signal dsr input dte output dce ok thats
five signals only four more interest request send rts
signal output from dte input dce used
 ask dce permission send data dce agrees sends ok
via clear send cts signal completeness cts input
 dte output from dce other two signals interest
 ring indicator ri data carrier detect dcd both inputs
 dte outputs from dce ri just what you would expect 
 signal dte saying someone attempting establish connection
 dce rather specific modem telephone line setup
dcd way dce announce connection has been established
ie local dce talking some remote dce thats oh
 many other rs signals defined obsolete i have
explained nine signals pc pinouts follows

name db db
 sg 
 td 
 rd 
dtr 
dsr 
dcd 
rts 
cts 
 ri 

now address your problem hand when you connect pc pc dte
 dte dce pair middle therefore rs
signal definitions dont work out quite right dce assert
 cts dsr dcd ri so common thing do use 
signals all also forget about dtr rts outputs well 
 done you simply make null modem cable passes through sg
 crosses td rd ie pin one end connects pin other
end etc problem solution pc wants send
data has way knowing other pc ready would have just
send data hope got through therefore better null modem would
include dtrdsr pair crossed particular point confusion 
software area just because you run wires does mean soft
ware use them you using builtin bios control 
serial port bios dictates what wires you need how 
 used you have comm package brooklyn bridge lap
link telix those packages dictate cabling requirements 
only thing you can guess reliably sg td rd dtrdsr also
fairly common one more issue needs addressed here 
 flow control rs scenerio dces responsible 
flow control assumed dce couldnt possible overrun 
dte i mean long dte has its dtr line asserted 
dce send data without requesting permission first note contrast
 other direction data flow dte must request permission 
asserting rts line must wait cts signal before can
send now dte dte scenerio question do you need flow
control answser usually how nonbinary communications
one common technique xon xoff which implemented software 
wires dedicated flow control td rd carry xon xoff
commands type flow control can used addition hardware
flow control problem you cant send binary data because
your data might include xon xoff codes cause erroneous conrol
signals work around have software insert extract escape
codes hardware flow control prefered problem hard
ware flow control standard lots ways 
do i bet have all been tried one cornerstone all methods
 use rtscts one direction beyond anything fair
game again you must look you comm package cabling requirements
 i bet youll find one cable wired properly could work 
all packages long same vintage way
i am familiar one package uses rtscts dtrdsr flow control
 rts request send dtr ready recieve cts 
clear send dsr request recieve does mean 
differnt cable just software clincher all cabling
stuff common have uart directly controlled cts
signal which means cts must present even you support
ing software cases you find cables short 
rts cts same end perhaps dtr cts other
possible shorting might done just because software expects certain
signals you dont have dont feel like providing because would
mean additional wires specifically i am talking about dsr shorting
 dtr dsr good idea general you may find cables like
 bad idea because defeats whole purpose one more
gotcha signal dcd some software including pc bios expects 
see dcd before work signal sometimes gets shorted 
dtr my favorite null modem has rts cts shorted each end 
 rts also connected through other end connected dcd 
 course dtrdsr crossed tdrd course sg must
pass through null modem works most software flow control
 any can use rtsdcd dtrdsr your comm package does 
specify cable required pc pc connection i suggest you use
 one
