wayne mcdougall had unmitigated gall say 

 wm software netware level ii i can see burnt 
 wm screen sft netware level ii va however configure netware
 wm level ii mirrored duplexed disks requires second disk yes 

 yes mirroring requires controller capable writing two
 disks once duplexing which preferred way mirroring uses
 two controller cards two disk drives duplexing requires special
 card two identical disk drives most cases duplexing can
 sometimes pulled off slightly different drivescontrollers long
 sizes same

 wm so how novell server normally configured

 configuration completely up user

 wm can i install sft netware level ii va level i 
 wm what causing my serialization error

 you only have one disk you cant use level ii sft however 
 osobj disk has serial number disk different
 version netware you would get serialization error make sure
 disk actually belongs rest set floppies 
 netware installation set

 wm novell server normally equipped two hard drives
 wm one which has failed

 two drives could either two netware volumes sft i one volume
 mirrored using sft ii impossible tell network being down

 wm would mean i can install network software because 
 wm serialized hardware failed drive

 try disconnecting failed drive using standard disk controller 
 installing software one volume under sft i software 
 install one disk functional should able work
 configuration

 wm what else can cause serialization error

 see comment concerning serial number osobj installation
 floppy
