john bongiovanni had unmitigated gall say 

 suddenly date longer rolls over time reasonably accurate
 allways we have change date hand every morning involves
 exiting menu system get dos
 
 jb did i once hear order date advance something like
 jb clock has make get date system call apparently clock
 jb hardware interrupt bios dont do date advance
 jb automatically get date call notices midnight reset flag
 jb has been set advances date

when program uses dos call get system resets flag 
tells bios has passed midnight uses flag 
increment date menu does call system get time
before midnight before bios sees midnight flag bios 
know day passed date get updated

i might have some doss bioss mixed up darned cold messed up my
brains has been well documented problem years i dont know
 workaround hope helps
