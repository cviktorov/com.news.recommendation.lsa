hi

i need some advice opinions regarding which pc would best suit my needs
i want use proposed beast basically four things 

 editing documents using wordperfect under dos

 creating graphsanalyzing data using sigmaplot v under dos

 editingplaying images using aldus photostyler running under 
windows images can large say k x k bitspixel

 using pc xterminal running desqviewx sun pcnfs 
talking our network sparcstations where lot 
 imagesdata come from most demanding tasks

ive read read read pc magazines performed benchmarks read newsgroup
 decided nice system priceperformance would 

dx k cache isa vlb meg ram
ati graphics ultra pro meg ram local bus
 monitor x ni
com etherlink iii bit
maxtor mb ide hard drive

however parts dont fit our local retailer apparently put one 
together only discover ati card wouldnt run mhz surprise
surprise actually after reading group im surprised even
have mhz local bus running

i have choice now between basically above system 
dx isa vlb dx eisa vlb thus
 nonlocal bus version ati card which better keeping mind
 im primarily interested last two tasks 

any help would greatly appreciated i need decide quickly so any 
speedy help would appreciated even more



btw we have system now perform tasks has following 
configuration

dx k cache isa meg ram
ati graphics ultra meg ram
 monitor x ni
smc ethercard bit
maxtor mb ide hard drive

were quite happy ati card very fast once data gets 
slow repainting images under photostyler have moved off screen 
been uncovered 

 doesnt seem enough raw cpu when running desqviewx its sluggish
running local window manager also many functions under photostyler take
 long time even when images fit entirely ram

theres enough memory system desqviewx meg smartdrive
dont leave much room other apps photostyler page disk 
medium size images

i have performed number benchmarks ethernet transfer rates 
machine sustains only ksec over ethernet while our sparcs sustain ksec 
 same network going bit version smc card increases
transfer rates ksec still very slow especially when moving large 
images thing localbus ethernet card coming 
make difference im hoping so leaning towards dx choice 
above reason

also dxs horizon what about dxs dxs 

any information greatly appreciated
