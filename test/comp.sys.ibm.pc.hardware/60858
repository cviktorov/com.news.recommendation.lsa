ide also uses dma techniques i believe floppy controller also uses dma
 most ad boards also use dma dma big deal has nothing 
do directly scsi

 simple style ide controller does use dma cpu performs
 data transfer string move instruction requires 
cpu stop what had been doing transfer data only smart drive
controllers ide scsi can transfer via dma controllers
tend cost same wether ide scsi get dma benefits
ide must sacrifice its price advantage controller

 example when rewinding formatting tape command 
issued controller bus released allow access other
devices bus greatly increases productivity least do
something else while backing up your hard drive which happens 
what i am doing while reading group

you can thank your software dos had few more brains 
could format floppies etc while you were doing something else 
hardware support dos least wont again has 
nothing do scsi

floppies arent ide bus your arguement makes sense isnt
 ide issue floppys have own processor controller
board which handles all commands

 difference between ide scsi all scsi peripherials 
intelligent each have own controller depend 
cpu do fewer things them ie ide drives needing processor
 transfer data

its long story i still use ide my except cdrom which
thanks scsi i can move between both machines when scsi 
better standardized supported ibmclone machines i plan 
completely get rid ide

 you stick dos youll wonder why you cant multitask

again i ask why cant unix os type os do all miraculous things
 ide harddrive can single scsi hard drive

 dettachcallback mechanism alows cpu make requests 
devices scsi bus dettach go about its business
later when device done issues callback say 
data has arrived function has completed most scsi cards 
also dma data memory without interupting cpu therefore
allowing continue working uninterupted ide supports concept
 dettachcallback 

can you see how would win any multitasking system
