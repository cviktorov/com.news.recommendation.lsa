 hi
 i am buying quantum lpsat mb hardisk deciding 
 hddfdd controller bit vlbus hddfdd controller faster 
 than bit ide hddfdd controller card

 vlbus ide faster than isa ide ide interface 
fundamentally nothing more than extension isa bus 
you hook vlbus itll work fast slower two
meaning isa speed

its true ide bus uses signals which has similar name same
meaning counterpart isa bus its ide bus signal timing
doesnt have same isa signal timing my vlide bus card has
 set jumpers set its transfer rate from mbsec up mb
sec manufacturer might have correct numbers 
milion bytesec milion bytesec respectively you
cannot transfer data rate mbsec isa bus

 i hear 
 vl bus controller slower than ide controller

 other hand i wouldnt expect slower
