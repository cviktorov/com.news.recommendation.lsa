case anyone wondering about upgrading class machine
without spending lot money i looked replacing processor
 those machines here facts i understand them

 you have ps model model you can replace i chip 
either cyrix dlc chip which increase your processing
power about normal fuctions all math functions
 chip only run your original clock speed ie you have mhz
machine cyrix dlc run mhz
note windows does use math functions so good upgrade 
you running windows
 you can get kingston now platform mhz isx
 which increase your normal processing power about you
were running mhz originally again increase speed
 your math fuctions i think continue run mhz even
 your original processor runs slower speed
 also kingston now platform mhz idx
 might speed up your math functions well i am sure

 you have ps model b other ps machine either isx
 nonclock doubling idx ie runs either mhz 
 you can get intel overdrive chip which really idx chip 
replace your chip you should get about better preformance 
both normal math functions mhz version overdrive chip
costs mhz version costs replacement 
mhz sx chip espeacially good deal provides math
coprocessor which sx does have note speed ratings 
overdrive chips maximum speed which can run you have 
mhz sx overdrive chip run mhz ie mhz externally
 mhz internally reason buy overdrive chip which 
rated faster your machine you get faster performance

you should able buy chips from any microchip merchants 
advertise back pc magazine pc week you might want shop
around prices do vary you need namephone number source 
 particular chip email me i respond couple sources
