 i want use proposed beast basically four things 

 editing documents using wordperfect under dos

 creating graphsanalyzing data using sigmaplot v under dos

 editingplaying images using aldus photostyler running under 
 windows images can large say k x k bitspixel

 using pc xterminal running desqviewx sun pcnfs 
 talking our network sparcstations where lot 
 imagesdata come from most demanding tasks

 ive read read read pc magazines performed benchmarks read newsgroup
 decided nice system priceperformance would 

 dx k cache isa vlb meg ram
 ati graphics ultra pro meg ram local bus
 monitor x ni
 com etherlink iii bit
 maxtor mb ide hard drive

 however parts dont fit our local retailer apparently put one 
 together only discover ati card wouldnt run mhz surprise
 surprise actually after reading group im surprised even
 have mhz local bus running

 i have choice now between basically above system 
 dx isa vlb dx eisa vlb thus
 nonlocal bus version ati card which better keeping mind
 im primarily interested last two tasks 

having mind size images my opinion go vlb
 has much more bandwith eisa which fact can utilized
 craphics card i have made measures so someone else may
share experience 

also dx faster operations run off internal
cache slightly slower off external about same off memory
so my advice vlb

 were quite happy ati card very fast once data gets 
 slow repainting images under photostyler have moved off screen 
 been uncovered 

 doesnt seem enough raw cpu when running desqviewx its sluggish
 running local window manager also many functions under photostyler take
 long time even when images fit entirely ram

 theres enough memory system desqviewx meg smartdrive
 dont leave much room other apps photostyler page disk 
 medium size images

have you tried running photostyler without cache need have
paging cache both well you might argue paging 
cached my belief measurements apps left more
memory manage better than smartdrvexesys

 i have performed number benchmarks ethernet transfer rates 
 machine sustains only ksec over ethernet while our sparcs sustain ksec 
 same network going bit version smc card increases
 transfer rates ksec still very slow especially when moving large 
 images thing localbus ethernet card coming 
 make difference im hoping so leaning towards dx choice 
 above reason

 bandwidth theoretical isa over mbs which far from
mbs i tried my isa ide hard drive maxtor mb got 
same results mbs regardless isa bus speed
mhz so i guess just carddrivers combination 
lousy

 also dxs horizon what about dxs dxs 

 rumors dx any most likely chip come
out note ibm closest technology only
sell whole motherboards so youll have upgrade mb

 any information greatly appreciated

just some view much figures
