 so when youve got multitasking you want increase performance 
 increasing amount overlapping you do
 
 one way dma bus mastering either make 
 possible io devices move data out memory
 without interrupting cpu alternative cpu move
 data several scsi interface cards allow dma 
 bus mastering
 
 how do you do busmastering isa bus

 earlier post noted through dma

 ide however defined standard interface
 created ibm pc which requires cpu move all data
 bytes dma

 were talking isa bus here you can only have dma channel
 active any one time presumably transferring data from single device
 so even though you can have least devices scsi bus explain how
 all those devices can dma transfers through single scsi card
 isaat bus same time

any one time means imho single byte xfer i have four sources 
dma requests ready dma would service one after other 
 bandwidth four together lower than isadma
bandwidth work

note bus mastering here priority mechanism dma
controller
