thinking buying from midwest micro ohio think very carefully
unless you absolutely sure you wont have any problems you may want
 trade elsewhere

despite fact answer phone hi im whoever were
having great day werent quite so happy when i wanted return
 modem didnt work i expected 

 details

i ordered one house brand infotel df internal fax modems
 reality twincom lightning fax had paper sticker over
 name given poor reports net about modem i would 
have ordered had i known advance

 arrived time documentation stated would work 
preconfigured com providing com use same time

 several reasons i have serial card configured comcom 
time i installed modem nothing connected com

although modem appeared work during every connection 
 would randomly break connection hang up phone after
spending some time phone midwests tech support suggested
disabling com port

 appeared solve disconnect problem unacceptable long
term solution i had have com available even though both
would use same time modem

i called back minutes prior closing waited voicemail 
hell listening repeated advertisements midwest micro products i 
 promptly disconnected apparently quiting time 
didnt want bothered callers had been waiting line

i called next day asked customer diservice agent rma
number she promptly switched me tech support rep implied 
 my equipment fault he wasnt going give me rma
number he suggested i use some nonstandard irq settings solution i
 happy modem should work originally configured

conclusion

im sure modem would work ok basic system clearly does
 work multi port system like mine since my time worth more 
than aggravation cost modem i gave local
charitable organization description my problem ordered
 practical peripherals mt from pc connection

 more i have solid external modem built company i know 
 support users sold company based personal
experience treat me right problem i should have
known better
