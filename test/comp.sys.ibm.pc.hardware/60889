 i am interested getting pulse group regarding
 extended operation my gk v cover removed 
 from enclosure reasons i am considering 
 including quick access jumpers during complex io card 
 setups
 
 my concern without complete enclosure direct 
 cooling flow air from fan hot spots may develop my
 motherboard elsewhere my gk has intake air vents 
 front enclosure right mb level vents would 
 removed along top cover scenario rendering
 airflow from fan pretty useless 
 
 however short periods mode dont seem heat things up
 too much my conclusions far from scientific
 
 tim

i ran out cardboard box more than year 
major effects yeah case all mb sitting static bag
other than noise from poersupply ran pretty good
 cooling problems i bought inch fan turned
 full set output directly motherboard

i did finally get case though i am still running parts
 ill effects

i also had kids spill things mb i had cat leaving
hair mb etc etc 

 two major concerns keeping static away keeping mb cool
enjoy
