what difference between us robotics courier vbis external 
sportster external i see price sportster has dramatically
dropped below price courier remains above 

anyone knowledge both modems anyone owns courier

 courier topoftheline product thus higher price ive
never taken real look sportster line only couriers from what
ive gathered its basically more entrylevel modem probably
doesnt meet same specifications courier does im sure
 sportster line fully dsp driven like more recent courier
modems so upgrades future may issue

again take all above grain saltive never evaluated
 sportster so im going bits pieces ive heard you
want real answer post question compdcommodems youll find
people who have worked sportster

personally though i were going look courier modems id
buy dual standardthen id get both hst vbis fact 
 exactly what i did im sitting here looking my usr ds right
now

 now correct few very incorrect statements folks you want
 get reliable answers modem andor uart questions post them 
compdcommodems you post other groups you never know what youll
get way answer you may very well get good answeror you
may get something like one below least cdm someone posts
complete utter bs youll see flurry folks correcting them 
avoid spreading faulty info

 sportster has v error control v bis data compression

just does lower speeds too absolutely nothing 
either ccitt recommendation v vbis says can only
operate modems running vbis vbis course 
currently only standardized operation top v its primary
mode operation lapm thats about far goes

 just case theres some confusion vvbis also
supported courier line unless you have really ancient one

 difference
 courier can run only hst mode 

take second look original question

 previous article cssdaemaccsmcmasterca holly ks says

see vbis up question about courier hst
modem about courier dual standardit about courier
vbis modem modem question does support hst period 
therefore does support kb hst

also all courier hst courier dual standard modems support kb
version hst my dual standard only supports hst kb 
even older models only run hst kb

 proprietary mode usr only connect another 
 same type unit achieve speed

hst usrs proprietary modulation scheme were talking about
hst were talking about vbis vbis most definitely 
proprietary modulation scheme

 sportster do
asynchronous transmissions well synchronous hst one way
only

i do hope you didnt mean two sentences related some
way

first off v vbis both synchronous asynchronous 
part ccitt recommendation ie part standard isnt 
feature unique sportster i just looked appropriate chapter
 courier ds manual

second hst one way only more correctly put 
asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning doesnt work same speed
 both directions hst operates one direction
 has lowspeed backchannel other direction highspeed
channel goes direction higher data flow fine 
youre logged say bbs type one letter get screens 
info back transfer files using bimodem etc course
 penalty turnaround time when highspeed channel needs reverse
directions

v vbis both symmetrical meaning do transfer full
data rate both directions same time

third synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing do 
symmetrical vs asymmetricalthey two completely different topics

 hsts upgradeable vfast spec when available

again more correctly put some courier line upgradeable
 whatever vfast called when its complete you have large
footprint courier modems like i do youre sol 
upgrade plan while back upgrade small footprint variety which
could eventually upgraded support vfast cost two
upgrades together pretty much put higher than just buying new modem

later
