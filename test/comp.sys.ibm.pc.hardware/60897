dont worry about whine fan go away about weeks
 use mine did
 vibration well something i thought about i have
 tower case mb mounted vertically so i mounted fan
 case so just blows air cpu its heatsink
instead work just like charm realy biggy think about
 after whine goes away fan fan should stop burn out
how would you ever know before cpu goes up smoke thats what
you should thinking about i have parts together have 
had time assemble them yet you build thermistor controlled
circuit turn pesso speaker led when temp goes
above normal operating range c abouts cheep do 
you use radio shack junk under think about one while
