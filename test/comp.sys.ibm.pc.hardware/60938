ibm apple motorola ready unwrap powerpc processor


 wraps come off powerpc processor week motorola
corp ibm apple computer inc detail results yearlong
effort first series powerpc processors bit
processor bit memory interface much like intel corps
pentium capability performing many three instructions
per clock cycle according sources familiar chip motorola
 expected release chip volume year end two
configurations running mhz performance 
specint marks respectively sources said floatingpoint performance
 volt processors even better specfp
performance respectively scaleddown
version power chip developed ibm its rs
workstations also include k single buffered cache chip
 protocols support motorolas bit multiprocessor bus
built chip which being designed initially support 
micro channel architecture bus independent so vendors could develop
powerpc based systems using number different architectures
including isa eisa sun microsystems incs sbus design one source
noted

according sources familiar development effort motorola has
been extremely successful developing powerpc inexpensive
architecture despite complex design made up more than million
transistors using micron technology initial chips expected 
 priced from only slightly higher than intel corps
 processors could sold profitably less than one
