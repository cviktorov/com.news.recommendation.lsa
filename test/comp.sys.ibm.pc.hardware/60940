 just got mhz dx system am considering getting fan 
 cpu processor when running too hot touch so i think 
 fairly good idea long ago when i did some electronics training i read
 somewhere regions within chip define junctionsgates etc
 slowly diffuse over time increases temperature hence hot
 chip goes offspec sooner
 
 has anyone out got cpu fan
 more than type
 do you have remove cpu from its scoket install fan
 do all cpu fans derive power from spare drive power lines
 anyone had any trouble cpu fans
 does anyone have any evidence cpu fans complete waste money
 how fans attached glue clips melted cheese
 roughly how much cooler cpu fan opposed without
 advert ive read claims f vs f
 
 any info appreciated
