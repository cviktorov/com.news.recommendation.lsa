 have anybody succeded converting atari monomchrome monitor 
 mono vga monitor so please let me know exactly how you did what
 graphics card you used

 i wish i could help i posted similar question about two weeks ago
 i got response all ive asked locally my friendly atari store
 i told should possible had idea how
 might done nor did particularly care investigate

ok heres my results so far

 you have define monitor lcd doesnt really support
 analogue video input works isnt very linear

 incoming sync pulses need inverting best achieved
 either cmos xor package transistor inverter
 you dont know how do dont even contemplate 

 itll only work standard vga mode

ok having said im trying either find circuit ic
which act universal sync decoder

i want somethikng which basically only detects leading sync
pulse edge doesnt care about polarity outputting
 ve going pulses atari monitor requires

 reasons doing 

 vga cards change sync polarity depending which mode theyre
 herc emulation while mvga example

 means i dont have put toggle switch back 
 monitor order able run off both atari my
 ibm currently i have yes monitors sitting my desk
 i want get number down much possible
 being able use atari monitor paperwhite vga
 cut things down i forget about atari colour
 i can get down 

ultimately best course action get multisync monitor
 im pressed cash anyone else so itll have wait
