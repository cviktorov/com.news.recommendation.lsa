 your problem 

 true i under impression people net had both 
 scsi ide working together

 its true you can get scsi ide work together 
 restrictions least adaptec 

 you must boot from ide drive way boot from 
 scsi drive you have both ide scsi drives

 you must disable scsi rom bios im sure about though
 so you must also use some special drivers access scsi
 drive hmm i know you have disable something related 
 scsi bios im sure rom itself

 back february someone asked about ide scsi question

 worth get scsi over ide noticable
 decrease access timeincrease xfer rate

 msdos applications isabased scsi ide controllers
generally have comparable throughput you might get slightly higher
throughput scsi disk youll also pay more disk
 up some cases youll also pay much much more 
good scsi controller

 note good scsi controllers really show power theyre
used good multitasking operating system like pc unix
unfortunately neither msdos nor windows good multitasking
operating system performance advantage scsi controllers 
mostly wasted which leaves advantage being able 
connect multiple devices scsi bus only advantage
however note you can expect pay premium scsi devices

 youre only going using msdos stick ide its
cheaper youll have less headaches

 virtually any scsi device chain controller my
 harddrive bernoulli box cdrom tape drive etc

 note following true msdoswindows only who knows what
 future holds windows nt unix 

 generally you have find drivers each scsi device
which probably dont exist unless youre using one betterhigh
performance scsi controllers typically busmastering scsi
controllers cost around street prices up 
drivers allow you connect controllers popular
namebrand scsi devices either come card can purchased
 under list price examples driver kits 

 adaptecs ez scsi kit list works only adaptec scsi
 controllers

 corelscsi from same people who make coreldraw list 
 driver kit supposedly work any scsi controller card
 has aspi driver like adaptec

 central points pc tools dos supports number scsi tape
drives documentation lists tape drives unfortunately 
works only adaptec controllers

 likely other problemsincompatibilities 
 scsi controller sound cardsvideo acceleratorsand similar
 equipment

 yes you run problems youre using 
highperformance busmastering scsi controller doesnt sound
right doesnt its true though one controllers
youll probably have tweak your system get work sound
cards floppycontrollerbased tape drives like cms jumbo 
windows i know ive been hll back getting my scsi
controller work various hardwaresoftware thank god tape
backups you want copy my adaptec hints tips file
send email

 problems arent really fault scsi controller card
 problems really general hardware software design 
 pc eg standards however adding busmastering scsi card
 what brings problems surface makes them visible

 scsi holds lot promise you can run lot pc
compatibility problems youre planning using only msdoswindows
 stick ide you want use windows nt pc unix youll
have make some hard decisions good scsi controller more than
one scsi hard disk probably give you excellent performance 
possible cost msdos compatibility i say probably because
while i know true pc unix i dont know really
 true windows nt i suspect i dont know
 sure
