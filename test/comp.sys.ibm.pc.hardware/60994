couple months ago i tried out hercules graphite card pretty nice
board fairly fast seemed quite compatible even seemed handle 
svga modes i have whined about here occasion time i just
buying vlb system so after checking out card i sent back i wanted
 vlb card purchased fahrenheit vlb card card fairly fast
 do hz refresh x compatible my cdroms
 svga thing i think i have merely conjectured cause 
 old graphics board being able run higher resolution those
programs than modern boards i have tried i have gotten straight
answer out anybody monitor i am using magnavox
which also tops out xx hz so its really pretty good match



 my wife i just purchased viewsonic myself am
looking graphics card drive i want hz refresh
 would really like handle my cdroms i tried orchid p
which did neither those things though robert wietek did say 
hz possible i modifed driver data base so my thoughts go back
 hercules were supposed coming out vlb version 
graphite around end march i have heard precisely zero about since
 does anyone know card actually released what capabilities
 price has

any info would most appreciated
