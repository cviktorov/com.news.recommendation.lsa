 just curious why floptical drives never seemed catch remember
 those mb disks look feel like floppies drives
 scsi devices can read write both kb mb
 disks sounds me one great product pc market 
 prices really unaffordable compared cdroms which currently
 rewritable i know about new rewritable cds expect sony 
 develop first mds computer my question why isnt 
 any substantial interest developing flopticals

certainly uk mb flopticals about same price 
cheap cdrom now you seem able get them around gbp
 however bigger optical drives eg mb much more
expensive around gbp mark

 couple questions someone may able answer mb
flopticals direct drop replacements floppy do
 need driver software etc ie do you just rip out floppy
drive plug same cables floptical stick floptidisk
 hey presto you have mb floppy sounds far too easy

 subject sony developing mds computers i have reread 
pcw article subject says sony have been doing
optical drives other people some time may about do 
product themselves from article seems audio md format
 byproduct computer storage work md mechanism 
identical mo computer optical drives sony spokesman 
quoted saying md disk would hold about mb data
though he refused comment any possibility being
productized

 article said one problems holding back development 
 area lack sensible standards plus least 
distinct optical storage mechanisms around present given 
probably needs mds being used distribution medium get 
 market since has already been cornered cds 
probably needs someone come very strong marketting lead
 get mds accepted
