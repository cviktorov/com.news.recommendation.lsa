 youre considering buying system view using
 run unix linux bsd etc some other special software
 good chance work diamond cards

 special software free like xfree 
vendors sells diamond x drivers commercial unices 
 charge 

 due diamonds propriety attitude its hardware
its impossible get free information from them about chips 
specifically dotclocks without paying signing nondisclosure
agreements

i think only need signing ie paying still
violates fsfs policy publically available code

 made impossible free software foundation provide
xwindows compatibility cards diamond didnt want 
divulge programming neccessities

while true fixes those who have already
bought diamond cards linux example utilities
 put card vesa mode before invoking x course
 means fine tuning diamond cards least 
 allow those whore stuck them use linuxx

i agree marks suggestion you buying video card
 specialized free software avoid diamond you already
have one may fix can help you
