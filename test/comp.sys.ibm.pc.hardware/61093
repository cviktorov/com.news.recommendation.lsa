some our students change ami bios passwords few our computers 
 set always what wed like know way bypass 
 remove password we have tried switching bios avail 
battery soldered bord all three machines still under 
guarentee so would have help we cant remove batteries

 far i know way get around bios password except 
shorting out power supply cmos memory thereby erasing 
 remove password also destroy all previous bios 
settings so youll have go set them all up again my 
 jumper motherboard which provided purpose 
shorting battery you just short jumper briefly interrupts 
power cmos long enough erase i would imagine
