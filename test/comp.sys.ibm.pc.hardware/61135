 which would you choose why

i have both

i have ide only my dros box ide scsi my unix box

ide dros box cos only has hard disk scsi my unix box cos 
has scsi hard disk cdrom tape

i bought scsi makes adding many devices easier price one
irq dma i have three different types device connected up

faster drives also available scsi i have dec dsps realy
does have ms average seek time ie finds data faster than my ms
toshiba drive

 
 like lots people id really like increase my data transfer rate from
 hard drive right now i have ms mb ide drive seagate 
 standard ide controller card my isa 

i dont think scsi increase your data transfer much isa bus 

 
 im currently thinking about adding another hd mb mb range
 im thinking hard about buying scsi drive scsi future benefit
 i believe im getting something like kbsec transfer right now according
 nu

kbs pretty good

 
 how would number compare i bought stateoftheart scsi card 
 my isa pc stateoftheart scsi hard drive best system i could
 hope 

many state art scsi disks use same mechanicals many state 
art ide drives only interface electronis differ look mb fijitsu
drive example

 
 obviously money factors choice well any other what would
 you want use your isa system how much would cost

i use adaptec b my unix box noname ide cards both

 
 along those lines what kind transfer rate could i see my ide hds i
 were buy topoftheline ide caching controller my mb ms hd
 how much would cost

caching controller why what does give you smartdrive dos does 
 about kb extra lower memory thats about 

 properly configured main memory cache produce better results than caching
controller my unix reads reads data from its main memory cache mbs thats
faster than standards isa bus can ever sustain


 
 thanks any comments
