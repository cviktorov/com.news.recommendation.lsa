 lpt com disk controller call devices 
 devices requires exclusive interrupt ownership eg disk
 controller i keyboard i also devices 
 does require exclusive ownership ie share 
 interrupt another device eg lpt
 
 standard isa bus one almost all nonlaptop pcs use
 two separate interface cards cannot share interrupt due 
 screwup bus design example your soundblaster wants
 drive interrupt number must hold certain bus wire 
 all times depending whether wants interrupt
 precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 
 
 when two more devices isa bus pc share interrupt its
 because theyre implemented single card

interesting would you care explain me how my soundblaster
pro card my printer card sharing irq successfully i assure
you both set irq i have problem my
computer dtk ibm clone

simple first andrew correct although i can see where might 
some confusion indeed possible have two cards configured use
 same interrupt can share interrupt sense 
 possible have both cards active same time

here example some time i short free interrupts i had 
tape controller floppy tape needed one irqirq its 
old tape drive my solution use irq also used com where my
modem i did because i reasoned i would never using modem 
 tape simultaneously when kermit runs installs its own interrupt
handler irq uses serial port tape drive were generate
 interrupt kermit would have clue what do withfor tape
controller since tape controller would serviced would
most likely hang likewise when tape backup software runs 
installs interrupt handler irq handler wont do anything 
 serial port

under dos printing interruptdriven instead bios polls 
status parallel port determine when another byte may sent
thats why you can have your sound card lpt both configured use irq
try nt see how far youll get
