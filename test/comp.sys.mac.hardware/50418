i believe apple has patent region features quickdraw mac
clone would have implement regions why apples comment 

 believe possible make mac clone without infringing
 patents may have other patents like 

apple has patented implementation regions which presumably
includes internal data structure which has never been officially
documented apple apple cannot patent concept region

im guessing either nutek reverseengineered apples internal data
structure regions i dunno would hold up court 
came up own data structure its latter 
wont able draw pict files containing regions besides pict files
 arent many places where regions stored disk quicktime
movies perhaps long region isnt being stored disk 
transferred from mac nutek clone vice versa doesnt
matter nutek uses completely different internal data structure

i remember reading apple also has patent adb hardware
 nutek clones would therefore lacking adb port what
other patents does apple have mac
