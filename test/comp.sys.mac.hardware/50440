approximately four months ago i purchased quantum lps hd from la cie 
 after two months drive started having problems first were
intermittent freezes corrupted files resources silverlining
 wouldnt even recognize drive so i got rma from la cie 
exchanged new drive reconditioned one

well about month has passed now second drive having problems
often when i boot up my iisi i get flashing question mark sometimes i
 insert silverlining program i can get recognize drive
 making scan over over drives point i can restart 
iisi boot from hd ive called la cie again theyve given me
another rma tech support people tell me silverlining doesnt see
 drive theres definite hardware problem

given second bad drive four months i asked la cie send
me new one said also within three weeks after i purchased
my original drive la cie dropped price over 

i can accept drive two may bad i know hardware vendors
make practice sending reconditioned replacements when do repairs 
i understand nature computer industry lends itself sudden
price fluctuations nevertheless taken together convergence 
factsevents have left bad taste my mouth i should have added above 
when i asked la cie transfer contents my current drive one
 sendi think data still good shape ill have again
reinstall everything from floppiesthey said would cost me data
recovery

 seems me reconditioned hardware should sold reconditioned 
discounted price replacements new hardware gone bad still
covered under day warranty should new 

i feel little helpless about all i dont mean necessarily flame la
cietheir support staff have always been friendly sometimes even helpful
 cmon sometimes little extra customer service goes long way i sent
 letter la cies customer service when first drive returned i
asked them credit price difference since i had purchased drive
three weeks before slashed price i told them i would like apply
 credit toward purchase another la cie product didnt even 
have courtesy reply one way other

whats moral story im sure i do know i wont buy any
other products from la cie future
