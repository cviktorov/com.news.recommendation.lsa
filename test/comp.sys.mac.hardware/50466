 kind slated wouldnt you say who going throw all 
 
 side get mac os 

 quite point considdered here
fact ifwhen apple release system what ever current time 
 release you see shortly afterwards apple longer producing 
hardwarelook next nextstep see what happens
who going pay apples prices when can get same thing cheaper 
else where heck we can get sun workstation cheaper than quadra 
infact we have number times all comes down 

 apple released before windows released id behind 
them
 missed boat so why apple continued development 
 support p its fullest capabilities run faster than windows 

 must do something significantly better than windows os warrent
 being released


 continued develeopment because becomming less less 
profit hardware so next step pun intendedwell sort 
 make money software look microsoft you think cant 
happen after all you can sell multiple pieces software one 
hardware platform

 you also said windows nightmare programmers so 
temptation sell system couple million dos users too much 
 apple million copies serious money
