i am looking any information about sigma designs
double up board all i can figure out 
hardware compression board works autodoubler 
i am sure about also how much would one cost

ive had board over year does work diskdoubler
 autodoubler due licensing problem stac technologies
 owners boards compression technology im writing 
from memory ive lost reference please correct me im wrong

using board ive had problems file icons being lost its
hard say whether its boards fault something else however
 i decompress troubled file recompress without board
 icon usually reappears because above mentioned licensing
problem freeware expansion utility dd expand decompress
 boardcompressed file unless you have board installed

since stac has its own product now seems unlikely holes
 autodoublerdiskdoubler related board fixed
which sad makes me very reluctant buy stacs product since
theyre being so stinky hey thats competition
