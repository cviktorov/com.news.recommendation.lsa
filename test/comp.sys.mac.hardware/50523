 what difference
 i want doublespin cdrom drive may
 
 looking nec apple doublespins only
 what best
 
 nec toshiba sony apple nearly deliver same speed
 apples prices very low compared ram simms
 you should buy what inexpencive think driver revisions
 easier get driver kits from apple than from every other
 manufacturer

i have cdtechnology drive toshiba mechanism 
supposedly fast best now has access ms data
transfer rate kbsec multisession photocd compatible 
available from educorp cdtechnology one comes two
mail coupons two free cds im sure cds good since
ive only had drive little less than month had cds shipped
 my home address california instead here maryland 
cdtechnology drive has separate power supply separated from drive
which supposedly gives longer life keeps cleaner fan 
attract dust toshiba brand drive also available i think 
cdtechnology better since you get same mechanism slightly
lower price two free cds

 apple i drive sony mechanism around ms access time i
think data transfer rate kbsec i know slowest 
three mentioned here widely available except through apple
catalog which bad price only also multisession photo
cd compatible i think external model comes free cds some 
which pretty good

 nec drive has been out longest has access time ms 
 data transfer rate kbsec available from many vendors around
 dollars including educorp wasnt multisesssion photocd compatible
before i hear current version shipping owners 
 older drives can get upgrade does come any free cds
unless you buy bundle

 three cdrom drives above i think best choices would 
apple drive cdtechnologytoshiba drive apple drive its
compatibility apple products cdtechnologytoshiba its
speed performance 

btw models drives 

apple applecd applecd i internal

cdtechnology cdt toshiba brand name model im sure 
 also something like 

nec cdr


im very happy my drive have had compatibility problems
whatsoever i am wrong about any above do correct me i am
pretty sure myself even when i think im
