returning old ram expecting see credit my visa within few weeks

well months went credit after many calls almost none which were
ever returned arghhh i finally found someone who told me why we never
received your old chips i explained i procedure i had
followed return them which person replied you mean you sent them
us mail which i had per original sales persons instructions i 
told loss us mail shipments uncommon come 
i should have sent stuff via fedex etc 


i also returned pb memory last summer credit sales person warned
me use us mail i did although i did insure shipment 
apparently techworks got 

my minor grip techworks have different price lists 
different people i ordered duo memory thinking i got best price
because my employeer i subsequently found out apple offering
developers memory less than techworks charged called up complain
 told i should have said i apple developer credited
my card about purchase price i like techworks quality

 outofca purchases sales tax chip merchant seems bit less
