 can running powerbooks battery completely flat have any
 detrimental side effects other than pb going i ask
 
 only two things i can think 
 although nicad c batteries should 
completely
 discharged about once month leadacid batteries shouldnt 
ever 
 completely discharged well maybe once while okay
 
 very common misconception dealing nicad batteries 
 
 good idea completely discharge nicad cell periodically 
 good idea completely discharge nicad battery 
difference
 being cell only one cell nicad puts out volts like 
 rechargeable aaa aa c d battery defined more than one
 cell volt nicad equivalent due differences 
 individual cells battery complete discharge can actually harm
 nicad battery more than help overcome memory effect 
 most common problem over time individual cell can develop
 internal shorts which weaken other cells connected 
 thus reducing lifespan your battery pack
 
etc

okay naive question how does one discharge cell without discharging 
 entire battery
