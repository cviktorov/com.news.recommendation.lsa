you can find retail within price keyboard educational
prices 

i would very wary retail outlets selling cheap educational prices
i went retailer actually mail order cda computers because its price
 better thant campus computer store i found out why later when i
tried get repair done apple registered repair center cpu 
resale serial number had been removed replaced nonstandard
number probably from cda computers consequently apple repair man could
 do any warrenty repairs so i ended up just day warrenty from cda
over apple month warrenty boy i pied moral story caveat
emptor

however you go reliable trustworthy mail order firm exist
 maybe someone could enlighten us experiences you probably
get better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order
out state does require sales tax yet though how much longer remains
 seen addition sales tax cpu purchase probably wipe out
 educational discount again caveat emptor some mail order companies do
include sales tax purchases even out state so check
