you can find retail within price keyboard educational
prices 

i would very wary retail outlets selling cheap educational prices
i went retailer actually mail order cda computers because its price
 better thant campus computer store i found out why later when i
tried get repair done apple registered repair center cpu 
resale serial number had been removed replaced nonstandard
number probably from cda computers consequently apple repair man could
 do any warrenty repairs so i ended up just day warrenty from cda
over apple month warrenty boy i pied moral story caveat
emptor
 
apple does authorise sales through mail order result mail order
companies have obtain machines grey market

 market supplied machines from authorised resellers who have
more machines than can sell come state affairs
 overordering either accidentally deliberatly get better
wholsale price from apple either case often obscure serial
nunber protect identity result warranty void

you may save sales tax you have pay shipping

i should also point out mail order companies cannot get lower prices
thatn high volume authorised dealers unless buy below dealer
cost result only way can sell cheaper cutting costs
 trimming margins unfortunatly dont seem doing too well 
 lowest prices i have been quoted mailorder do beat lowest
prices available from authorised local dealers

 even further away from educational prices
