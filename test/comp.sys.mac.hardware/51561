 i am working data acquisition analysis program collect data
 from insect sensory organs
 
 stuff deleted
 
 another alternative use sound input port

 can you really make due nonexistent dynamic range bit
 converter probably dubious linearity monotonicity perhaps
 accoupled well

 clearly depends type questions you asking many
cases do fine critical information from neuron 
 firing frequency maximum about action potentials per
seconds amplitude signal details 
signal shape so resolution about you get bit
convertor more sufficient

ac coupling does have problem either since many cases
you interested dc level my pre amplifier ac coupled
also critical point lowest frequency pass 
 cutoff point high action potentials slightly
distorted even normally does matter since 
occurrence spike important 

however i do want know what exactly i can expect before i start
battling toolbox get going yet i have clue were
 start looking technical specifications
