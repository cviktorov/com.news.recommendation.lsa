 necessarily thridparty adapter apple does manufacture transceivers
 thinwire baset twisted pair cable media well aui
attachment unit interface transciever run each you use
thinwire baset youll probably also need terminators apples
transceivers selfterminated i remember correctly i have 
idea about decs 

 thirdparty media adapters usually cheaper least toronto than
apples i bought adapters from asante instead apple

 decstation models come thinwire only
cant say certain about models so your best bet

thats true only decstation comes thinwire
bnc coaxial ethernet connector 
all have single pin aui ethernet connector only i distinctly
remembered because when got first i thought all
 them going thinwire i eventually had go back ordered
destas decs oversized version auitobnc adapter must used
 transciever cable rest stations

my advise very original poster beverly 

 all you want create lan two workstations wont add
 machines ever go thinwire regardless media type going
 utp unshielded twisted pair wiring requires concentrator which
 means extra money i believe units come least ports
 thicknet its nightmare cabling expensive avoid 
 unless you have choice eg two machines two floors parts

 mac side you need
 one thinwire media adapter from apple thirdparty
 macx make sure you get version wont run system 
 mactcp which comes macx you get macx v you should 
 getting mactcp v dont use earlier versions centris
 you may may need ohm terminator depending 
 thinwire media adapter so just ask sales adapter 
 selfterminated 
 configure mactcp use ethernet

 decstation side you need
 model you only need tconnector
 models you need auitobnc adapter
 get one can plugged directly aui port 
 decstation way you save cost transciever cable
 pin aui male pin aui female cable
 get ohm terminator

your twomachine network look like
