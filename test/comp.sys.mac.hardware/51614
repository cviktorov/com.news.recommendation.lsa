 attention mac quadra owners many storage industry experts have
 concluded mac quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
 from standard scsi specification results silent corruption
 data when used some devices including ultramodern devices
 although i name devices since fault 
 example would sony inch mo without special maccompatible
 firmware installed one solution sometimes disable blind writes

 doesnt sound right me dont quadras use c so 
mac has nothing do scsi timing thats all handled 
chip about only timing could wrong apple programs 
clock registers wrong however should only really hurt
synchronous transfer which used mac scsi manager

furthermore disabling blind writes should meaningless quadra
 macs used which much lower level scsi chip 
mac responsible handshake each byte transferred blind
mode affected how mac handled handshake 
handshake entirely handled chip

 docs say its scsi manager bug changes things all
