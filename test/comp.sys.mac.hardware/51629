 i cannot speak dale i am quite sure macintosh 
uses full bit bit data path its full advantage 
 running fast two four pin simms would one 
pin simm now may longword accesses assuming bit 
data path here get first byte from first simm second byte 
from second so would mean each longword memory 
 actually split among four simms one each byte other hand 
 could simms interleaved word longword just 
 byte could successive memory memory 
controller deals eightbit data path each one has i 
suspect though interleaved some extent so bits 
can read written once would indicate bytelevel 
interleave
 i am confusing new machines longword 
interleave two pin simms same sort although seems 
 same sort idea you get essential bit data path ro 
excuse me ram instead just bit one yes cpu cant 
handle when writing successive addresses speeds something 
up
 so dale am i right pin simms interleaved bytes 
allowing full data bus common usenet me 
particular am i clueless everyone else

what conclusion can drawn from im trying figure out what kind
 memory configuration lc iii bit datapath would fastest any
ideas

thanks
