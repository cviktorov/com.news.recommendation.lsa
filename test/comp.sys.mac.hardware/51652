 while ago i posted note asking specs quadra opinions 
 q upgrade iici vs accelerator card so far responsed 
 ive noticed please let me know what you think possible upgrade
 paths cost efficiency proscons etc thanks
 
 complete q best obtained from your dealer some recent
 copy macworld macuser my foggy memory suggests most relevant
 comparison factors visavis iici follows
 
 mhz 
 mhz data path dont recall sure its slower
 than q style machines sure
 ethertalk card onboard
 audio inout
 mb ram motherboard
 simm slots
 nubus slots
 more flexible buildin video than ci uses vram
 
 comparison iici accelerator wont give you
 audio ethernet same video options
 accelerator cpu performance can comparable i
 think ends up costing more
 
 greg dudek

 actually accelerator daystar mhz cheaper than
upgrading q mhz accelerator costs about whereas
 upgrade costs just quoted from my dealer however q
upgrade gives you very fast built video supports monitors up 
 bit depth up bit depth additional vram 
also has scsi port capable much faster throughput than ci which
makes big difference you have fast hard drive

 improved video scsi features important you youre
better off getting q upgrade otherwise save some money get 
accelerator
