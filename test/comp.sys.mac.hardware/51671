hello all

 few past days ive been fighting get my nec multisync d
predecessor fg work properly internal video mac
iivi

 vgaadapter described dale adams posting about quadra
video works only some minor interferences occur small enough 
 prevent any action screen visible clear

 because scanrates stuff d well enough emulating
apple rgb i first made adapter got one fron local
distributor nec
 both adapters i can get picure which looks excellent most 
 time every now 
 radical changes screen opening palettes large windows
etc major interferences sync picture either tilts
sideways scrables up totally even when clear some
spiky interferences horizontal line alignment when accessing
pulldowns etc
 selfmade adapter almost identical vga one only
sense pins differ sometimes impossible even boot up 
picture clear enough shut down from menu
 adapter from nec everything well most time 
sometimes picture tilts badly sideways sync completely
lost nearly often selfmade one

i know self made adapters can always interference 
 one provided nec wheres source interference

ill give you pinouts whole mess i hope you can
 least someone please try figure out what could best pin
assignment nec d
i am going make completely new cable maximum shieldings 
isolations soon someone figures out how pins should 
arranged especially syncs groundings
