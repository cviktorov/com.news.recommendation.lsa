id appreciate greatly someone could email me following
 you only know one thats fine
 specs esp how compares pentium

specs can fill page book some highlights 
bit address space w bit data width bit integer registers 
 bit floating point registers k copyback capable caches
way set associative typical clocksinteger instruction 
clocks floating point multiply

interesting aside can multiply two bit floating point
numbers less time than can multiply two bit integers

 specs estimated cost release date etc

more same multiple instruction dispatching figure
about clocks per instruction typical my guess motorola
guys pretty bright may less

im interested speeds systems can run windows nt risc whatever
costs bus info register info all technical info

call motorola im typing all 

i am hoping can win yet another battle against intel people

im predicting both x x lines reaching 
ends new experimental processors have bit data pathways can
schedule up out instructions each clock cycle sort
 trick cant really done cisc architectures

i finally saw some details pentium greatly
impressed theyve finally done some work fpu get up 
speed otherwise its only going x speedup get
 theyre using two integer units larger caches branch
target buffer yes i know theyre talking about mhz processors
big whoop designing mhz board difficult really
expensive priced ns memory chips lately
