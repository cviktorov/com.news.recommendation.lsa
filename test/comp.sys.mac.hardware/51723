i cant help you firstclass telefinder ive been using zterm
 
zyxel close two weeks now heres what i did

once zterm set hardware handshaking bps rate 
youve
probably already done i typed

atd
atw

 first line sets modem ignore dtr line necessary 
hardware
handshaking most though all mac hardware handshaking cables

second stores setting nonvolatile memory modem so its 
default when modem starts modem preferences dialog i have 
modem initialization string set atzm which just insures 
stored setting used useful starting zterm after using something like

fax software macwoof which change settings other ways 
alternatively you could leave factory default way just
set
 zterm initialization string atdm which would accomplish 
same
thing modem always before you start zterm other
programs
dont modify settings atzdm would work even other
programs
modify modems settings i do way i do because i sometimes
forget
 turn modem before launching zterm way im assured 
having
 correct dtr handling when modems powered up
 
after comparing above strings my commands reference guide i
came up 
atzlnxdsm
 entered initialize box modem preferences zterm
quick summary each commmand
z reset modem user profile 
l speaker volume fairly quiet
n ring volume fairly quiet
x display connect info according setting see manual
d assume dtr computer always 
s dial speed fast zyxel can handle

 firstclass i used same string addition s right
before s command setup box disables autoanswer 
function modem firstclass i based my modem setting supra
fax just changed above mentioned string

 telefinder i based my setting zoom v hh setting i changed
 modem initialization string same one i used firstclass 
everything seems work fine

sorry took so long get summary out someone wants forward
 infomacreports directory sumexaim might save other
newbie zyxel users like myself trouble setting up strings 
also save net some redundant messages anyone else has something
 add feel free
