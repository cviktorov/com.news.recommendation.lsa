 i dont know about instrutech boards though i plan check them out
 you need very careful checking monotonicity sn ratio 
 many bit boards out ni boards very clearly
 specified terms monotonicity sn ratio accuracy etc 
 nba nba have all dyynamic range freedom from
 distortion youd expect from good true bit converter 
 true spectral innovations boards example

 boorishly reply myself i found i did have instrutech information
already specs use term loosely follows

ad bit converter bit accuracy khz bit accuracy 
 khz specs sn monotonicity linearity multiplexed
inputs sharing single ad so all inputs samples 
same time above conversion specs allchannel sample rate
must used thus two channels you only have unknown quality bits
 khz per channel poorer quality than national
instruments same sample rate

da bit converter specs sn monotonicity linearity each 
 output channels has its own converter

 price external converter box itc nubus interface
board mac plus c driver software igor xops rather
steep
