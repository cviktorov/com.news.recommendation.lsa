i believe goes go

powerpc
pentium









i think kind comparison pretty useless general 
processor only good when good computer designed around adn 
computer used its designed purpose comparing processor speed 
pretty dumb because all you have do just increase clock speed
 increase speed among other things

i mean how can you say faster than without 
giving operational conditions can you say same when 
you running program uses lot transidental functions
knowing does have transidental functions building 
its fpu does can you say still faster

anyway i hope people do decided upon wether computers
 good solely its processor how fast processor 
based its name because one can alway do certain things 
processor speed up 

 we restrict our arguements example pure
processor architectural issues how one processor work
well another based its design we can get
somewhere our discussions

 resent article one macmags i think mhz accelerator 
 slightly slower than mhz accel using system designed
 so stands reason system designed ie
 quadra would do better so overall id figure so
 along same lines new powerpc stuff supposed run system
 level fast quadra system whatever allow times 
 speed powerpc based systems wait i think
 laps pentium
