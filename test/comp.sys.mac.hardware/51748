i agree gentlemen who wrote comment before me
 important thing pick what ever interest you most 
learn much possible about 

 my five years education field though brief 
compare alot people i had think about kind 
question lot did i make right decision going 
electrical engineering opposed computer engineering 
cs more i go thru school more i believe 
kind question irrelevant 
 
i have come believe choosing cs because one 
does like hardware choosing hardware because one does
 like program really doing injustice building
 computer making useful something everything
 interwoven inseparable cs ce ee all 
part really great discipline do depend each other

my advice dont limit yourself make decision
based which major give you best opportunities 
learn course depends curriculum your 
persective school i would choose major allows me 
explore much possible beside i dont know why 
school would make student choose major before herhis
sophamore year
