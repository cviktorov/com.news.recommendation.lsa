 hi i own lciii i recently heard interesting rumor
 i heard lciii has built slot powerpc chip
 true i heard slot same pds
 slot true
 
 thanks

 well i also have lc iii popping top revealed

 one socket additional vram simm

 one socket pin ram simm

 one socket flatpack fpu

 processordirect slot pds identical lclc ii 
 additional set connetions one side full bit
 data path lclc ii lacked

 thats i guess board powerpc chip could made would fit
 pds thats only place

so possible have nubus pds powerpc upgrade 
require logic board swap would interesting apple come out 
 nubus powerpc allowed use cpus x like rocketshare i
guess thats getting bit fantastic

i wondering since macweek reported developers were seeded 
powerpcs nubus card

also any word machine arrivals estimated speed last i heard 
estimates were around times speed quadra native risc mode i
heard apple employee mumble something about arrival powerpc machines
 much earlier date q i doubt its true

finally powerpc developers cd minicourse available i saw 
advertised developers university calendar id like know its
 all interesting

radius speculated publicly could provide powerpcbased
rocket existing macs would have plus rocketshare 
 minus nubus accelerators true boot off accelerator
nubus bottleneck video other io

apple seems compete third parties here except
perhaps notyetavailable macs like cyclone where powerpc
slot might advertised look daystar make powerpc
accelerators

one potential problem any accelerator though 
need rom companion apple has licensed only radius 
rocketshare use any its proprietary code

apple between lines trying let us know powerpc macs
 have simplified logic boards due magical nature risc
 boards should much cheaper build than those 
existing macs perhaps well see groundbreaking
prices maclogic board upgrades much same way weve seen
much cheaper highperformance cpus year

first generation powerpcs s also hopefully have socketed
cpus so theyll chip upgradeable s year later
 should possible much same way s can pulled
 clock doublers too much technical baggage which
i doubt since external busses same sizewidth do
 perhaps we can have cpu daughterboard la powerbook 
standard facilitate better cpu upgrades area where
apple has fallen far behing intelbased world perhaps catchup
 order

 way last weeks pc week had excellent story powerpc
pentium mips r dec alpha big four microprocessor
front forseeable future worth reading technojunkies
also latest pc has cover story pentium read all
 other stories about how intel unstoppable preeminent
right now

once anyone secure due fall intels market
position never again dominant today especially
 amd gets go ahead sell its s week appears 
might competition from all fronts gearing up awesome
battle apple users should excited powerpc while 
guaranteed dominance guaranteed winner even its one 
several
