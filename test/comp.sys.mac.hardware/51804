i have tried almost everything under sun get null modem connection
between mac duo pc i have used mackermit versaterm 
 mac side i have used procomm kermit softerm os 
 pc ps side i have used nonhardware handshaking hardware
ahdshaking cables know my hands shaking from effort nothing
has allowed file transfers from mac ps

 general i can type back forth trouble only both sides
 set speeds over baud i cannot send files from mac 
ps all file transfers from duo ps possible
when i do straight ascii send i can send from ps duo flawlessly
i can send binhex files way quite fast i know 
transmission error free
 straight ascii sent from mac ps full errors
unless course i do text pacing so slow like human
typing well like times faster than human typing

i would like hear from anyone who has been able transfer files
from duo ps via modem null modem you can do please
tell me your exact combination hardware software obviously i am
talking true serial port modem express modem maybe some
kind soul access modem duo can check out me

right now i am opinion wont work high speeds because
 power interrupts duo wont work low speeds
because some crazy reason i dont understand

could i hear from someone attesting can really pump information
out serial port duo fast like via modem via 
sysex dump

could anyone duo help me out i am going absolutely insane
i wanna know problem my duo all duo s all duos
 just me

yes i have checked cable times only can i type
back forth zterm alerts users she uses hardware handshaking
 cts down so i know hardware handshaking working also
according zterm port stats buffer never overflows
