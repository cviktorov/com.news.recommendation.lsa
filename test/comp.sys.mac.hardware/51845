im market laser printer used printers fine nonapple
printers fine whatever printer i get must fit following

required features

 postscript

 dpi

 emough memory download fonts

 cheaper better id prefer under 


nice things

 anything over pages per minute

 scsi output font disk

 smallish footprint



dont care about

 postscript level ii

 networking its just me always 

 color


i know about freedom press ive also heard its painfully slow
i can tolerate about ppm anything slower than im going
 consider price savings worth id curious hear peoples
experience tho 

i also infinitely prefer laser over ink i used use hp deskjets 
my last job wasnt impressed quality im laser bigot
 first admit 


ill using printer layout pages book im writing 
page include multiple fonts ps graphics scanned line art 
maybe greyscale pictures sure yet quality doesnt need 
 spectacular needs clear readable


printers ive been looking 


 used laserwriters plus nt ntr its my understanding 
 only ntr has scsi out disk true

 personal laserwriter ls ntr i have access apple employee
 discount i work one apples spinoffs so i can get reasonably
 cheaply ive heard bad things about ls comments im leaning
 towards personal ntr cause has nice small footprint

 laserwriter select i hear doesnt have postscript i havent
 seen anything sure i heard mumbles once about postscript upgrade
 

 used hp laserjets ive worked ii iip another platform 
 were painfully slow bad mac

 ive seen ads epson ps laserprinter running quite cheap
 any comments printer i hate styling too many ouput trays
 its decent printer ill consider 


thanks any comments
