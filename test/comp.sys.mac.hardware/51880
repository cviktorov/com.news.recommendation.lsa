 i dont know about specific problem mentioned your
 message i definitely had scsi problems between my
 q my venerable jasmine megadrive cartridge
 drives my solution get silverlining none 
 loops involved blind writes worked drives
 fact only loop worked macintosh
 software loop whatever means
 
 i doubt quadraspecific problem i had get
 rid my venerable bernoulli last year enough 
 cartridges purchased each make whole thing 
 worth more than my whole computer tech support guys
 ocean microsystems suggested some thirdparty drivers 
 might fix problem my case cartridges wouldnt 
 formatmountpartition aux 
 
 all i know megadrives worked perfectly both my
 mac plus my powerbook reason i assumed
 problem had something do quadra even 
 quadra mostly worked ok problem occurred when i ejected
 cartridge from drive would start popping up dialog boxes
 saying cartridge must formatted jasmine driveware
 even though cartridge drive

i have been using pli sony mo drive now sharp color
scanner using standard scsi cables standard terminator my q 
 problems you were using iifx might another story

make sure only one terminator cabling must 
end some boxes have internal terminators some can switched out 
others socketted count box internal terminations
cannot put end terminate cabling have 
disabled ie switched out pulled out sockets you have 
boxes internal terminations terminations one box has 
disabled etc i am sure has been covered experts

my experience scsi boxes connect mac indicates 
must have some software package mac talk them my pli mo
drive sharp scanner has one each

good luck
