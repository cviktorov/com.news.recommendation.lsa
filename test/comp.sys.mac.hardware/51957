enter game developers sound driver current sound manager 
inconveniently lame making games

 sound driver pretty ok since its fast sound manager used 
book useless disposing sound channels soon sound has completed
 out question games smooth animation its too slow

 sound driver so much snappier than sound manager unfortunately
system supports poorly making programs crash occasionally

 more story developers dont cheat
really i am absolutely positively allowed do what i am about 
do
 im going say anyway
stop cheating sound
really soon you sorry even those without external speakers
 disappointed your sound future hardware grace period
 about end
 sound manager understandable now works pretty well 
work
even better soon so use 

well i want my code work old systems too i dont know about sys 
 least bugs sound manager causes
channels hang error message happends when i keep 
channel open long periods necessary performance play many
sounds stopping sounds halfway callbacks seems reliable
 only way i can safely tell sound has stopped playing 
inspect private variables channel qhead i think 
only way i have found tell channel hung inspect 
undocumented flag modify 

am i happy nope i consider writing soundbase simply get
rid bugs

any better suggestions silent games among acceptabe solutions
