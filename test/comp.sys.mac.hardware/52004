 ftp 
 

 where can i ftp mac software 

 three major north american internet archives shareware
 freeware demo software sumexaimstanfordedu 
 macarchiveumichedu wuarchivewustledu
 which mirrors other two sites several
 others wuarchive often holds files after other sites remove
 them space concerns still has files were deleted from
 formerly important site rascalicsutexasedu rascal 
 notable storing its files macbinary format rather than 
 less efficient binhex format common other archives unless
 otherwise noted shareware freeware mentioned document
 should available above sites
 
 keep traffic internet manageable scandinavians 
 should try connecting ftpfunetfi ftplthse
 sicsse instead those 
 uk should look first srcdocicacuk 
 continental europeans can try nicswitchch 
 ezinfoethzch anlanlfr 
 australian users should try find what want archieau
 which mirrors infomac macarchive japanese
 users find sumex mirrored ftputokyoacjp
 

 fourth very important site ftpapplecom 
 apples semiofficial repository system software
 developer tools source code technical notes other things
 come more less straight from apples mouth some material
 site may distributed outside us other
 sites dont have official license distribute apple
 system software please read various readme documents
 available ftpapplecom detailed info youre
 connecting from outside us you wish redistribute
 material you find here


 can i get shareware email 

 infomac archives sumexaim available email from

 where can i find application x 

 you cant find what youre looking one above
 sites try telnetting your nearest archie server sending 
 email message addressed archie subject help 
 archie servers located archierutgersedu 
 america archiemcgillca original archie server
 canada archieau australia archiefunetfi
 scandinavia archiedocicacuk 
 uk continent sites index tens 
 thousands files available anonymous ftp login archie
 password needed type prog filename find what
 youre looking type help more detailed instructions 
 instance you would type prog disinfectant search 
 convenient ftp site disinfectant initial search fails
 turn up file you want try variations substrings 
 name instance you didnt find disinfectant prog
 disinfectant you might try prog disi instead substring
 searches often hide gold pile dross avoid many
 erroneous matches add hqx end substring eg
 prog disihqx most mac software available net ends 
 hqx almost unix pc software does 

 please check above archives archie personally before
 asking where you can find particular piece shareware you
 follow above advice you should almost never have ask 
 net where find particular piece software


 can someone mail me application x 

 nor anyone mail you part file from
 compbinariesmac corrupt missed your site please
 refer first questions section find out about
 anonymous ftp archie automatic email servers


 what bin hqx cpt etc 

 most files available ftp modified twice allow them 
 more easily pass through foreign computer systems first theyre
 compressed make them faster download theyre
 translated either binhex hqx macbinary bin format
 other computers can digest macintosh uses special
 twofork filing system chokes most other computers binhex
 files bit ascii text files while macbinary files pure
 bit binary data must always transferred using binary
 protocol
 
 how file has been translated compressed 
 transmission indicated its suffix normally file have
 name something like filenamexxxyyy xxx indicates how 
 compressed yyy indicates how translated use file
 youve ftpd downloaded your mac youll need reverse 
 process most files you get from net require twostep
 decoding process first change binhex hqx macbinary
 bin file doubleclickable macintosh file decompress
 which programs decode which file types covered table
 below also note most macintosh telecommunications programs
 automatically convert macbinary files regular macintosh
 files downloaded

 few notes decompressors

 stuffit family products use several different
 compression schemes freeware stuffit expander unstuff
 all them versions stuffit earlier than stuffit 
 stuffit classic unstuffit stuffit deluxe 
 unstuff increasing number files stuffed stuffit 
 you need get more recent version stuffit stuffit
 expander 
 
 stuffit lite deluxe consistently makes smaller
 archives than any other macintosh compression utility allow
 maximum space files various ftp sites keep
 netbandwidth down please compress all files you send anonymous
 ftp sites stuffit 
 
 uutool maccompress suntar handle popular unix
 formats uuencode uu compress z tar tar
 respectively unix versions often more robust than mac
 products so use them instead when thats option translators
 allow stuffit lite expand uuencoded tar files also
 available anonymous ftp 
 
 macutil dik winters package unix utilities 
 decompress debinhex files workstation before downloading
 them mac since unix stores files differently than does 
 mac macutil creates macbinary bin files which should 
 automatically converted download cant decompress
 everything particular cant decompress new stuffit 
 archives however you need only one two files out 
 archivefor instance you want read readme find out 
 program does what you need do before you download all 
 itmacutil indispensable can found sumexaim 
 infomacunix directory

 few notes compression formats

 bin macbinary files always use binary file
 transfer protocol when transferring them never ascii text 
 most files net stored hqx instead only rascal
 stores most its files bin format most communications
 programs zterm mackermit capable translating
 macbinary files fly download know advance
 theyll downloading macbinary files
 
 image format normally used only system software
 so online users can download files can easily 
 converted exact copies installer floppies instead 
 using diskcopy restore images floppies you can use steve
 christensens freeware utility mountimage treat images 
 your hard disk actual floppies inserted floppy drive 
 mountimage has reputation being buggy so you should have
 some blank floppies copy diskcopy handy just case
 
 sea x x sea files dont merit position above
 table because theyre selfextracting may have been created
 compact pro stuffit even diskdoubler all should 
 capable decompressing themselves when doubleclicked some
 unknown reason alysis has chosen use industry standard
 designation selfextracting archives created 
 payware products superdisk more disk space instead 
 append either x x selfextracting archives


 how can i get binhex stuffit etc 

 far easiest way get programs ask human
 being copy them onto floppy you youre 
 university theres absolutely excuse finding someone 
 give you copy youre anywhere less remote than mcmurdo
 sound chances very good someone computer center
 dealership user group can provide you copy stuffit 
 once you have stuffit any version you dont need binhex
 
 youre computer geek thought actually
 asking living breathing human being instead computer 
 terminal something turns you quivering mass 
 protoplasmic jelly you can probably download working copy 
 stuffit from local bulletin board system 
 
 you have religious objections software gotten any 
 means other than anonymous ftp i suppose ill mention 
 you can fact ftp working copy stuffit though 
 far hardest way get ftp wuarchivewustledu 
 login type word binary hit return type cd
 mirrorsrascalicsutexaseducompression hit return 
 get stuffitexpanderseabin hit return course
 its always possible time you read stuffit
 expander have been updated name changed so 
 fails look something similar youve ftpd straight onto
 your mac you should now have selfextracting archive which 
 produce working copy stuffit expander when doubleclicked 
 youve ftpd your mainframe unix account first you still
 need use modem program download your mac just make
 sure mac receiving macbinary mode mainframe
 sending binary mode you need more details last
 step consult faq list compsysmaccomm manuals
 both your mainframe macintosh telecommunications software
 
 
 how can i get binhex stuffit etc from pc 

 you cant absolutely way get executable
 macintosh file from ftp site onto pc onto your mac
 without some software obtained means other than anonymous ftp
 you must beg borrow steal necessary software 
 binhex stuffit lite from another person i realize may 
 terrify those among you who havent left your parents basement 
 since you got apple ii eventually youre going 
 need link up some human being other than your mother 
 though i suppose youre much nerd you could send 
 your mother out get you while youre gathering
 your nerves venture strange terrifying world 
 daylight please dont bother net asking question
 again simply way move executable macintosh
 programs from pc other nonmacintosh computer onto 
 mac without software bundled most macs




troubleshooting what do before posting when things go wrong 
 

 while various faq lists cover lot specific
 problems far more problems arent covered here 
 few basic techniques you should follow before asking
 help you should probably also perform tenstep
 preventative maintenance routine described section four
 especially rebuilding desktop resizing system
 heap following steps may may solve your
 problem least make easier others 
 recommend solutions you

 identify problem 

 microsoft word crashing doesnt say much what were you
 doing when crashed can you repeat actions lead 
 crash more information you provide about actions
 preceding crash more likely someone can help you 
 more precisely youve identified problem actions
 preceding step easier tell 
 following steps fix problem example sometimes
 quarkxpress crashes coprocessor installed error 
 nearly helpful quarkxpress crashes when i link two
 text boxes master page when copies those text boxes already
 contain text former leave you wondering whether bug
 remains after given step latter lets you go right 
 problem see its still 


 read read me file 

 many companies include list known incompatibilities 
 bugs read me files often arent documented 
 manual read any read me files see any problems sound
 familiar


 check viruses 

 run disinfectant another antiviral across your disk virus
 infections rarer than most people think do occur 
 do cause all sorts weird problems when do


 reinstall application all its support files 
 
 half dozen reasons external magnetic fields
 improperly written software alignment planets file
 disk may contain data its supposed contain 
 can cause all types unexplained unusual behavior restoring
 from original masters normally fix 


 reinstall system software 

 bits even more likely get twiddled system file
 than application effects can just disastrous 
 see question detailed procedure performing clean
 reinstall 
 
 problem continues occur after youve taken 
 steps chances youve found either conflict between your
 application some other software genuine bug 
 program so its time 


 isolate problem 
 
 you need find minimal system which problem
 assert itself here basic steps isolating 
 cause system application crash
 
 arun only one application time occasionally applications do
 conflict each other problem does manifest itself
 without other applications running simultaneously you can begin
 launching other applications until you find one causes 
 crash
 
 bif youre running system turn off multifinder youre
 running system allot much memory application you 
 can afford sometimes programs just need more memory especially 
 when performing complicated operations
 
 c youre running system turn off virtual memory bit
 addressing theres still awful lot system hostile
 software out including some from companies really 
 have excuse can you say microsoft word boys girls 
 i knew you could some software only expresses its 
 incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions taken
 
 dboot from virgin system floppy problem disappears
 you likely have init conflict you need progressively remove
 extensions until problem vanishes use little common sense
 when choosing first extensions remove problem occurs
 when you try open file remove any inits mess 
 standard file open procedure super boomerang first 
 problem remains after obvious candidates have been eliminated
 either remove remaining extensions one time you have
 lot them perform binary search removing half 
 extensions time once problem disappears add half 
 most recently removed set back continue until youve narrowed 
 conflict down one extension when you think youve found 
 offending init restart only init enabled just make 
 sure alone indeed causing problem


 contact technical support 

 now you should have very good idea when where why
 conflict occurs tech support number available 
 software call youre lucky company have work
 around fix available perhaps theyll least add 
 bug database problems fixed next release

 

 
 preventive maintenance 
 

 you wouldnt drive your car miles without giving 
 tuneup computer different regular tuneups avoid lot
 problems although mac mechanics wholl happy 
 charge you more equivalent oil change theres
 reason you cant change yourself following ninestep
 program should performed about every three months 


 trash unneeded files 

 many operations follow run faster more
 smoothly more free disk space work so spend 
 little time cleaning up your hard disk youre all like me
 youll find several megabytes worth preferences files 
 applications you longer have archives software youve
 dearchived shareware you tried out didnt like announcements
 events have come gone many other files you 
 longer need youre running system you may also have several
 more megabytes your trash can alone throw them away empty 
 trash


 rethink your extensions 

 some macintoshes attract inits like new suit attracts rain 
 seriously consider whether you actually need every extension 
 your collection you dont use functionality 
 extension least every fifth time you boot up youre probably
 better off storing your system folder where only takes
 up memory destabilizes your system slows down every startup 
 instance you only read pc disks once month theres 
 need keep accesspc loaded all time cutting back your
 extension habit can really help avoid crashes 


 rebuild desktop 

 desktop filedatabase holds all information necessary
 associate each file application created 
 lets system know what application should launched when you
 open given file what icons should display where 
 depending its size each application has one more
 representatives desktop file applications files
 move off your hard disk desktop file can become
 bloated corrupt think congress your mac 
 every so often its necessary throw bums out start 
 clean slate fortunately its easier rebuild desktop than
 defeat incumbent 
 
 one warning rebuilding desktop erase all comments
 youve stored get info boxes under system maurice
 volaskis freeware init commentkeeper retain those comments
 across rebuild commentkeeper also works system only 
 apples desktop manager extension also installed 
 
 rebuild desktop restart your mac your
 extensions finish loading depress command option keys 
 youll presented dialog box asking you want rebuild
 desktop warning you could take few minutes 
 click ok take more than few minutes more files you
 have longer take youre running system you may
 want turn off multifinder before trying rebuild desktop
 
 youre experiencing definite problems just doing
 preventive maintenance you may want use fifth generations
 freeware init desktop reset desktop reset completely deletes 
 desktop file before rebuilding thus eliminating possibly
 corrupt data structures 


 zap pram reset clock 

 all macs from original k thin mac quadra 
 contain small amount battery powered ram hold certain
 settings properly move cpu rather than disk
 which disk boot from unfortunately parameter
 ram can become corrupted cause unexplained crashes reset
 under system hold down command option p r keys
 while restarting your mac under system hold down command
 option shift keys while selecting control panel from 
 apple menu click yes when asked you want zap parameter
 ram since youve erased almost all settings general
 control panel you should now reset them whatever you want
 
 one setting zapping pram does erase 
 date time since internal clock macintosh 
 notoriously inaccurate youll probably want take 
 opportunity reset anyway


 resize system heap 

 even after rethinking extensions per step two most
 people still have least half row icons march across 
 bottom screen every time restart all 
 extensions most applications too need space section 
 memory called system heap system heap isnt big enough
 comfortably accommodate all programs want piece 
 all start playing king mountain system heap
 knocking each other off get bigger pieces themselves 
 trying climb back after get knocked off all 
 fighting amongst programs severely degrades system performance
 almost inevitably crashes mac
 
 youre using system your macintosh automatically
 resize system heap necessary youre running system 
 its important set your system heap size large enough manage
 all your extensions applications default size set
 k way too small most macs any extensions all 
 system heap size stored normally noneditable boot
 blocks every system disk bill steinbergs freeware utility
 bootman only lets you resize your system heap even checks
 how much memory your heap already using so can tell how much
 needs allocated youre running system get bootman
 use amazed how infrequently your macintosh crashes


 reinstall system software 

 system files can become corrupt fragmented especially 
 youve stored lots fonts desk accessories inside them 
 merely updating system software often fix system file
 corruption i recommend doing clean reinstall heres how

 boot from installer floppy your system disks 
 copy any nonstandard fonts desk accessories out 
 your system file temporary suitcase
 trash system file your hard disk also trash 
 finder multifinder da handler all other standard apple 
 extensions like control panel chooser all 
 replaced new installation youre running 
 installing system move everything extensions 
 control panels preferences folders top level 
 system folder
 rename system folder any name other than system folder 
 fine
 doubleclick installer script your system disk 
 choose customize select appropriate software your 
 model mac printer you could do easy install instead 
 only add lot extensions code you dont 
 need waste your memory disk space
 once installation finished move everything from 
 temporary folder you created step new system 
 folder youre asked you want replace anything you 
 forgot take something out step youll need replace 
 things individually until you find duplicate piece 
 reinstall any fonts das you removed step 
 reboot you should now have clean defragmented system file 
 takes up less memory disk space much more stable 
 system overall


 disk utilities 

 much like system files hard disks have data structures 
 occasionally become corrupted affecting performance even
 causing data loss apple includes disk first aid simple utility
 detecting repairing hard disk problems its system
 disks its also available anonymous ftp from ftpapplecom 
 directory dtsmacsyssofthdsc even you have earlier 
 version you should get latest version from ftpapplecom
 run all your hard disks
 
 several companies have released payware disk utilities 
 detect repair considerably more problems than disk first aid
 though interestingly none them detect repair everything
 disk first aid does three most effective general
 work central points mactools deluxe fifth generations
 public utilites symantecs norton utilities macintosh
 department work group should have all well
 disk first aid since none them fix everything others do 
 individuals mactools street about half price 
 norton street public utilities street so features
 ease use being roughly equal i recommend mactools
 
 all products occasionally encounter problems 
 cant fix when happens its time backup 
 reformat 


 backing up 

 one part preventative maintenance should 
 done lot more often than every three months simplest back
 up merely copy all files your hard disk onto floppies
 other removable media you keep your data files separate
 from your application support files its easy only back
 up those folders which change frequently nonetheless every three
 months you should do complete backup your hard disk 
 
 number programs available make backing up
 easier apple included very basic full backup application 
 system performas apple ships new apple backup
 utility can backup entire disk just system folder
 onto floppies previously mentioned norton utilities 
 mac mactools deluxe include more powerful floppy backup
 utilities incorporate compression incremental backups
 
 finally youre lucky enough have tape drive network
 server removable media device use backups you should
 check out more powerful payware utilities redux street
 doesnt support tape drives diskfit pro street 
 freely available backup utilities other than old hd
 backup from system 


 disk defragmentation 

 disks fill up gets harder harder find enough free
 space same place write large files therefore 
 operating system often split larger files pieces 
 stored different places your hard disk files become more
 more fragmented performance can degrade several
 ways defragment hard disk
 
 most tedious cheapest method backup all your
 files erase hard disk you might well reformat while
 youre see question restore all files
 
 number payware utilities including norton utilities 
 mac mac tools deluxe can defragment disk place ie
 without erasing although ads all products brag
 about safety once youve bought software opened 
 shrinkwrap all warn you back up your disk before
 defragmenting case something does go wrong 
 freeware shareware disk defragmenters so please dont annoy 
 net asking one 


 reformat your hard disk 

 just floppy disk needs initialized before use so 
 hard disk must formatted before can hold data you dont
 need reformat every three months when your system
