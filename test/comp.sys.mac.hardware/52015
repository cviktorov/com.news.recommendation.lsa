murray

put me down pb ext floppy appletalk remote acces
ac adapter fresh out box used buyer switched 
 arrival sold unopened box purchased last october 
later i bought used powerport v bps internal faxmodem 
something like im using right now works great 

 real complaints i love my portable system got color home setup
also mac ii reasoning matlab programs school other
simulations dynamic control systems sometimes took hours 
overnight run tying up my mac ii i got pb fast modem
 do light work ontherun stuff i figured id give my
little sister next year when she goes college its running system
 now without any problems also i sometimes do dec terminal
emulations matlab our universitys vaxvms nice thing 
benchmarks itself average times faster than mac iifx
so pb just does graphical output terminal emulation 
too hard all fabulous setup weeee

 way all matlab software class accounts i also 
ta class used simulabsimulink we had sitelicense 
takehome thendestroy later siterelease licenses pirating
 incase youre wondering great program 

just like add whatever future system you get you can almost never
get enuff memory buy while its cheap buy when you
get computer since its usually cheaper than upgrading i always
run out disk space i have syquest mac iisi so i
never worried about space before got several carts
