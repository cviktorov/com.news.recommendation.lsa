 even better than how does based amiga perform 
 daily tasks compared my based iici

 answer except very few cases i get my butt kicked amiga
 sure other considerations goes show you how
 proper design from beginning hardware software can give
 you great returns well showing you you dont have 
 marketing department speak one care how good your system 

ive had same experience actually i love mac interface any number
 features am sorely dissapointed speed i use macs daily
 am moc consultant osu statistics department im familiar almost
every model out my experience both amiga atari
st simply blow mac out water terms performance time
i would general say other advantages mac outweigh 
advantages amiga st falcon i really wish apple would
get heads together speed could take real lesson 
mulitasking from amiga os multitos atari falcons too 

 im still happy my ci i dont understand why performance 
 so bad comparatively could have done multitasking properly
 could have done everthing else better apple didnt
 course dos windows nothin write home about either

i just hope someone comes out machine does everything well
someday i had my choice i would go mac most aspects add 
speed superior multitasking other platforms

 original topic trying compare just chip machine seems
almost worthless fast wizbang graphics accelerator 
faster productivity many applications than even stock quadra add 
graphics accelerator you really fly course add one 
quadra youre blowing away etc
