here how i modified my quadra higher speed previously i
had been using variable speed overdrive accelerating my cpu
 modification testing out more stable higher speeds

your mileage may vary top speed you achieve cannot predicted
before hand my personal q has tested fine up mhz thus far
i didnt have higher speed clock oscillators hand test higher
speeds

parts

clock oscillators pin ttl variety you need selection 
speeds beginning mhz up cpu run 
oscillator speed original one mhz unit i recommend
getting mhz clock case you damage existing one

 i obtained my clock oscillators from digikey 
 less than each some part numbers 

 mhz ttl clock oscillator part x
 mhz ttl clock oscillator part x
 mhz ttl clock oscillator part ctx

 dont get half size clock oscillators wont fit

 also cmos clock oscillators i havent tried one 
 quadra work fine iisis
 
socket obtain pin socket which same form factor 
 pin dip package alternatively use machined socket pins
 from augat style socket just cut them out socket

cooling fan very small volt fan keep cpu cool 
 must my vso came specially modified heatsink which had
 fan built onto had passthrough connector which
 tapped hard drive power cable you should rig up 
 something similar risk frying your cpu
 
procedure

 insert usual disclaimer antistatic warnings here

 remove top lid machine you see floppy disk 
 hard drive mounted plastic tower follow usual antistatic
 precautions course make sure machine off when you do
 unplug all cables wall monitor power supply cords from
 back mac
 
 remove power supply pulling plastic interlocking tab 
 tower forward simultaneously pulling power supply straight up
 tab piece plastic from left posterior aspect 
 tower which extends downward hook power supply you may
 also feel horseshoe shaped piece right portion power
 supply leave alone plastic tab from tower all you
 need release
 
 look rear tower assembly you see flat ribbon
 scsi connector hard drive power cable flat ribbon cable
 leading floppy drive disconnect all from motherboard
 hard drive power cable connector has tab which must squeezed
 release 
 
 unplug drive activity led from its clear plastic mount

 look down posterior cylindrical section plastic tower 
 phillips head screw base remove taking care drop
 case bit gummy glue your screwdriver helpful
 here

 remove tower assembly pulling medially plastic tab 
 right side tower tab prevents tower from sliding
posteriorly slide entire tower assembly cm posteriorly 
lift tower assembly straight up out case

 remove interrupt switch assembly strangely shaped plastic
 device left front edge motherboard pull middle
rear plastic prong up forward entire device release

 unplug speaker cable squeeze plastic tab speaker 
 free swing backwards free from case

 remove motherboard form case lift front right corner 
 motherboard about mm allows clear clear plastic
power light guide slide motherboard forward about cm 
motherboard comes directly out

 locate mhz clock crystal small metal box near 
 cpu chip note remember its orientation new clock oscillators
must aligned pin same orientation

very carefully desolder remove old clock oscillator some 
 pins may bent over simply desolder unbend them sure
your desoldering iron hot enough before heating board

i used suction desoldering iron accomplish task 
 appropriate first soldering experience motherboard 
 multilayer design very fine traces easily damaged without
proper care

 install your socket socket pins where old oscillator once 

 put mhz clock oscillator new socket you could use 
old clock has solder its pins may come inside 
socket cause corrosion problems later i suggest using new
 mhz clock

 install your cooling fan system complete modification

 reinsert motherboard slide place

 snap interrupt switch assembly speaker lock mother
 board firmly plug speaker wire back motherboard

 reinstall tower assembly first placing right wall 
 tower against right wall case tower assembly about
 cm posterior its intended position lower tower assembly 
place while maintaining contact right wall case
 once fully down slide tower assembly anteriorly until clicks
 place

 reconnect motherboard ends cables dontt forget floppy
 drive cable

 replace phillips head screw

 drop power supply straight down place until clicks 

 plug hard drive activity light back its clear plastic mount

 reattach your cables power cords cross your fingers turn 
 mac should make usual power chord doesnt
something amiss immediately turn power recheck your
handiwork all well you have my sincere condolences

hopefully all work normally turn machine back off 
replace mhz clock oscillator faster one reboot 
 astounded 

you need fully test machine many hours before deciding
 particular speed truly usable my vso machine lockup
might take hours operation occur brief time since
modifying my clock oscillator hours i have had single
problem

good luck all who attempt modification small real
risk you could well reach quadra speeds higher less than
 parts
