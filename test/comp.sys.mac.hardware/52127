 electricy consumption go down you turn them off overnight
 along heat

i wonder how hard would ie what would add cost
 design desktop machines power saver feature built which would
reduce power consumption automatically machine idle more than
some amount time pretty standard portable machines 
same kinds tricks could played spinning down disks turning off
screens reducing clock speed etc advantage over just turning
 thing off would you dont have remember do anything 
 machine still available over network

 tricky part might defining what constitutes inactivity
certainly you dont want wake up from sleep mode just because somebody
pinged you you do want wake up least cpu somebody
logs via telnet connection

i wouldnt worry too much about wasting electricity winter
months energy just getting turned heat may 
efficient way heat building central heating plant its
 too bad summer though its disaster only you
wasting power youre probably also running air conditioning 
get rid waste heat
