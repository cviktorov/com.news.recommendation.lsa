i have se generation systems bit pds card 
screen
 worked great until i upgraded from mb ram
now sys mode enabler does boot

 tech support person said card does support bit
fixes

i guess he right early versions rasterops cards did either
 fixed people problems can get free rom upgrade
from rasterops

 when pressing shift key while booting when ext monitor
goes black after having been grey system sometimes boots properly
 works ok mb full graphics

whats happening

very easy you boot without mode control panel 
disable rather reinstall bit clean patches so when
you run ok you must bit adressing mode check about macintosh
 see you havce mb system

thanks lot any advice
