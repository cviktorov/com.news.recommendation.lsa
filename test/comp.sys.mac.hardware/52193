we having problem quadra has stumped couple 
techs sent us vendor well us 
 quadra stuffed mb ram mb vram some large disk mb
i think what happens after certain variable interval time
 video circuitry loses vertical sync quite apparent 
mac cpu still ok problem really seems lie video
circuitry since you can still save your documents quit your aplpications
even pull down menus etc only display scrolling lik crazy so its
pretty hard hit menu items 
we had original logic board replaced twice now same problem
has been occurring all boards although inteval between occurrences has
varied first board had problem every about hr more often 
cache turned off yes off only symptom 
obviously related video circuitry after all cache cpu
right second board had problem every about minutes we did
 keep rather we put original back current board we have
has problem lot less often has gone about week without doing 
 did twice within hour yesterday
 technicians have come out try figure out seemed pretty
sharp tried number sensible things most which we had
previously tried ourselves anyway included
swapping ram
swapping vram
swapping monitors different apple rgb apple rgb
swapping cables
disconnecting hd booting from floppy
sacrificing various small mammals
here some other facts
when we put rasterops procolor nubus problem fixed
 does occur internal video procolor video out
 vendor cannot reproduce problem back shop boards
 exhibit our lab
apple said getting little bit pissed off shipping us boards
 cannot find anything wrong getting them shipped back 
 faulty according us
here some speculations
i bet neither apple nor vendor has tested boards 
 much ram vram them simultaneaously which may have something do
 finding hard reproduce problem though we can
 reproduce just mb ram so probably red herring
 vendors representative blames metal your walls claims our
 walls have metal them which interferes macs operation we
 have another lab which works like charm though its 
 exact same spot please dont tell me probably i do
 want believe 
its probably poltergeists since do have badges get past
 security entrance our site

has anyone any ideas please please email well posting cause i seem
 spending lot time rebooting my mac lately have lot less
time available read news 
thank you advance
