 more story developers dont cheat
really i am absolutely positively allowed do what i am about 
do
 im going say anyway
stop cheating sound
really soon you sorry even those without external speakers
 disappointed your sound future hardware grace period
 about end
 sound manager understandable now works pretty well 
work
even better soon so use 

dont silly

using sound manager quadra very well using sm 
any lowend machines doesnt simply work decent action
game since just steals too much time from cpu 
 fact writing directly hardware se 
possible have simultaneous channels sampled sound khz 
 cost approx cycles exactly how would you do using
 sm pray tell

 correct thing do use sm machines can
carry extra load using sm means write directly
 sound hardware machines cant its 
politically correct thing from developers point 
view
