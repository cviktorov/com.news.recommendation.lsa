 spending lot time rebooting my mac lately have lot less
 time available read news 

 you sure its problem caused software ive seen sort 
 effect when runaway program which could caused init 
conflict instance accidentally wacks register video 
hardware have you tried booting extensions letting 
q just sit finder you might also want try changing 
bit addressing yes i know you cant access your full mb ram 
its just experiment video hardware registers cant accessed 


another thing try recovery measure use something like 
quickkeys change pixel depth display reprograms some 
 video hardware registers may allow sync restored
