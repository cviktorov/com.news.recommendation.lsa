hi 
i have mac lc consider buying cd ive been told
however 
 double speed cd achievable only machines
 scsi

 completely false

 double speed prerequisite photocd multisession
 capability which i need

 also false what you need multisession capability 
multisession capability which based firmware 
electronics drive speed ill admit though i have
 seen multisession capable drive isnt double speed

 which means i seem gain nothing compared say cd

 above proves false

any comments

 apple cd excellent doublespeed multisession photocd
capable drive so drives based slightlyfaster toshiba
xm some companies selling drives spin peripherals 
bargain pli company i hate relax technologies
 company i know little about other than longtime
player mac mailorder which usually good sign nec
cdr also good choice necs own mechanism i think clubmac
sells around

spin peripherals 
club mac 
relax tech 

nothing wrong apple though which based sony

advantage very slight average access time minor plus
 data transfer rate slightly more important plus

good luck
