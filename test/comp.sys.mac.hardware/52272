hmmm thats quite right performa real darn close
 iivx better buy imo i also dont think so
much lowcost business solution lowcost home solution
why else bundle ease among other things hardly business
application 

what do you mean retail price quite contrary i think
 price darn near same all across country again
imo one selling points performas ie haggling
required kinda like saturn car computer set one
price medium performance ready go

when i shopped my performa cd difference between sears
sigh montgomery wards silo sigh circuit city sigh 
bizmart sigh couldnt have been why i chose one over 
other based solely availability friendly salesman who
went extra mile when did you last hear about someone who
sells apples admittedly except montgomery wards i
suspect i just lucky all salesfolk i spoke didnt know
didly about computers peecee mac neither did any
 apple dealers i spoke 

 you wouldve told me year ago i would buy macintosh from
montgomery wards i woulda laughed long long time go figure
im real happy my performa oh i bought apple
performa plus monitor vs buying rd party happy 
decision well i walked plopped down some cash walked out
