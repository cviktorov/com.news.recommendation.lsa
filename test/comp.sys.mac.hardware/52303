 i am looking new lc iii used iici prices

 iici has much greater potential expansion la nubus 
 greater memory capacity

how important how many nubus cards do you haveplan 
acquire how much memory do you really need ive got ci 
mb ram thats plenty i also have bit graphics card
 nubus im sucker pretty picturesi think 
lciii can have bootable ramdisk memory which ci can
 have least out box

 lc iii would new under warranty newer roms iici
 bit clean would have sound input i also like 
 pizzabox case

 ci bit clean i solved sound input problem 
 macrecorder thats gotten fairly expensive
solution now macromind owns macrecorder

 performancewise i have read almost identical 
 lc iii being little slower

 actual difference probably worth worrying over
 
 so which should i get

depends price you can get ci educationally speaking
 lciii here fsu can had just under add
 roughly monitor last id heard mb lciii simm
went 

i think youre winwin situation matter what you decide
youll most likely happy
