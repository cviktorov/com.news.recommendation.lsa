 hi
 do any you hardware gurus out know what kind memory 
 architecture apple uses powerbook duos powerbook
 general
 
 what factors make duo so slow compared desktop 
 machine running same processor same speed mhz how 
 many wait states memory system etc what kind data 
 bus does use bit bit 
 
 
 huh where did you get idea from i think you got 
 backwards duos memory faster than its equivalent desktop
 machine rest powerboks i think 
 explanation can refresh faster instead 
 cycles i believe things could affect performance would 
 factors use functions enhanced fpu which duo
 doesnt have undocked extensions background applications can
 slow your computer down too real life differences speed likely
 influence software you running what kind screen
 depth you running etc
 
 espen
 
 ps duo bit throughout


thanks enlightening post technical note 

 desktop machine i referring actually mac
 rather any various workstations use 
mhz old suns old nexts i used own next
 cube 

 i try rebooting without extensions see what kind 
 speed difference i get my powerbook duo i did notice 
extreme slowdown unusability mac plus after
installing system why does os suck up so much cpu
power 

also youre rightsoftware does make huge difference i
have misfortune using msworks my duo when editing
relatively small k files cut copy takes several
seconds often more than seconds happens power
cycling turned off usual ms software maggotinfested
feces 
im getting nisus replace my text editing
