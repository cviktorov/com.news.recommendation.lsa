yes one thing think about pricing m harddrive 
configuration when i got my lowly classic ii options were m
harddrives clear buying another m harddrive space 
would cost much more than difference price between two config
uartions analogous break lciii prices 
you regret spending extra money larger harddrive 

particularly you ever wind up wanting use softpc which sets up 
severalmb up partition you generating large files 
 dtp software you might ever want check out mac unixlike 
os like machten having extra space helpful when you 
pricing used iicis look harddrive size come how much
 would cost you add more storage down road might 
useful bargaining strategy even you see reason go over m though
i must admit i am packrat within months getting my 
computer i backing up lot stuff floppies i rarely use 
because i running out space without having started using dtp stuff 
softpc trying any unix os
