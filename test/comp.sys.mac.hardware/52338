i thought id share good experience too i bought aps quantum zero
footprint drive may back when still used two separate leds 
front panel case metal while traveling my
se mac bag top mac past winter one plastic tabs
holding front panel broke so right side front panel
 coming forward away from rest drive i lived situation
until became completely intolerable which more less coincided 
network shutdown school trip out town i had take which gave me
some dead time during which have drive sent out

i called aps rma got one questions asked about how 
tab got broken handled little roughly airline baggage handlers 
though nothing else damaged well except internal speaker my
modem which wasnt well glued down begin yeah yeah im
never flying my se again when i called back ask whether i
could send little later rather than right away had problem
 even when i exceeded normal valid period rma 
day theyre usually good days front panel replaced under
warranty drive shipped back quickly i mailed first class
insured saturday noon from la missouri came back fed
ex friday i dont know exactly what day came back because i 
traveling week from wednesday afternoon sunday afternoon

 only thing couldve been bad first service rep i talked
 attempt prevent jeopardizing my data suggested i take 
drive mechanism out send just case unfortunately i discovered 
day i mailing thing would necessitate breaking little
seal thus voiding warranty oh well
