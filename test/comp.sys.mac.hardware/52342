 most part bunch bunk ive got computer engineering
degree yet ive spent last years writing software people actually
use moreover salary distinctions incorrect i received job offers
upon graduation two jobs actually used my hardware experience were
year lower my advice decide which classes projects most
interest you pick major allows you take them

emt

well here my worth advice from grad student

i agree gentlemen who wrote comment before me
 important thing pick what ever interest you most 
learn much possible about 

 my five years education field though brief 
compare alot people i had think about kind 
question lot did i make right decision going 
electrical engineering opposed computer engineering 
cs more i go thru school more i believe 
kind question irrelevant 
 

 interesting i think computer technology now
becomming widespread enough now longer position
which must require degree i know several people i work
 make just much i do dont even have
 bs degree comp sci yet make year also
didnt have pay grand thier local university either 
 i think computer programming being reduced trade
practice than truly specialty field even more
so future
 your interested cutting edge type stuff you
choose cs i did i suggest checking out emerging field
 software engineering difficulties example designing
scaleable design environments individuals so single person
can handle million lines code all himself
 reasonable manner incorporate teamwork enviroment
 truly gigantic problemnot going solved any time soon
unfortunatelybut hey you could person provides
 missing key some good groundwork

i have come believe choosing cs because one 
does like hardware choosing hardware because one does
 like program really doing injustice building
 computer making useful something everything
 interwoven inseparable cs ce ee all 
part really great discipline do depend each other

my advice dont limit yourself make decision
based which major give you best opportunities 
learn course depends curriculum your 
persective school i would choose major allows me 
explore much possible beside i dont know why 
school would make student choose major before herhis
sophamore year 

hey you may so interested field you 
decided learn all about making computers which 
case you suffer little more go grad school

about money dont look averages you
 good you going earn more money than anyone else 
 you superstar programmer you earn millions 
like wise you hotshot computer designers 

well your like poor slobs worldlike me you 
 financial position continue graduate work right out
 top comp sci school

 trick find some generous inc you work pay 
rest your educationtrust me its best way goeven
 you dont get top salary which i have always been poor
slob throughout school you follow rule booksalaryfoodshelter
you should always have computer you wont go hungry

what else could man want
