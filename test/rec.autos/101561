 id like add beretta gtz car which kick gsr butt
 anyday its lot cheaper boot

 i take one definate grain salt performance data shows 

 poster has some proofother than my friend blew one away last week


 want proof here some data acceleration handling from
motor trend apr 

 integra gsr beretta gtz

 
 mile 
l acc gs 
slalom 
wrong
why dont you look again motor trends slalom times right
along integra car does small inch tires 
 all weather xgtv mention integra rides alot better than
 beretta
your acceleartion times also vary magazine magazine
road track car driver have gsr road track
also quarter mile times vary from 
you cant tell exactly numbers furthermore integra 
definately outrun beretta high end car driver road track
have gsr doing mph gets fast


 so beretta can out handle integra can certainly keep
up acceleration beretta probably has higher top
speed due horsepower advantage hptorque 
integra vs beretta
you always believe those exact numbers why dont you drive gsr see
 your self while gsr has low torqye its high gearing over 
rpm make up difference still wouldnt call torque moster though

 biggest advantage would have price integra costs
 tested motor trend gtz costs tested 
gtz also has standard nicities airbag antilock brakes airbag
 available integra lower models do have abs
considering you save almost dollars beretta quad
 reliable engine doesnt make sense get integra 
performance coupe which what people have been trying make out
 


quad reliable yeah whats your definition reliable thats reliable
 its safe say integra engines general near perfect
 mention hell alot smoother quieter balance shaftsthe acura has engine
 wins reliablity contest hands down you can rev car all day everyday
 youll never blow hose crack block anything else i speak
from expierence
im saying quad bad engine dont highlight reliability when you
comparing acura engine while integra costs alot more 
better investment since hold its value considerably much better 
does nice job being sporty car practical same time

note isnt flame gtz other gm quad products berreta
 nice car puts out respectable performance very reasonable
price mention has airbag start quoting figures from one
source isnt too reliable read other sources drive both cars while i
havent driven gtz i have driven gts grand ams quad engines
so similair
