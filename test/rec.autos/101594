 id like add beretta gtz car which kick gsr butt
 anyday its lot cheaper boot

comparing gtz gsr apples oranges somewhat like mustang 
 crx both have very different ways doing things ought 
appeal different buyers ie i dont think acura owner would
 seen dead chevy dealership vice versa

stuff deleted

 all weather xgtv mention integra rides alot better than

 integra i have seen comes allseason tires 
 gtz does come much bigger wheels

along integra car does small inch tires 
your acceleartion times also vary magazine magazine
road track car driver have gsr road track

 cd figures almost certainly bogus based hot prototype
supplied acura mt figures more plausible

also quarter mile times vary from 
 sounds reasonable probably faster than regular integras

 so beretta can out handle integra can certainly keep
up acceleration beretta probably has higher top
speed due horsepower advantage hptorque 
integra vs beretta
you always believe those exact numbers why dont you drive gsr see
 your self while gsr has low torqye its high gearing over 

 gsr gearing horrible day day driving needs speed
box more than any other modern car essentially th regualr integra
equals th gsr regular integras very buzzy speed

rpm make up difference still wouldnt call torque moster though

considering you save almost dollars beretta quad
 reliable engine doesnt make sense get integra 

 only person i knew gtz had bought back gm lemon 
 piecve junk very quick fwd

quad reliable yeah whats your definition reliable thats reliable
 its safe say integra engines general near perfect

 only gsr owner i know had engine throw rod less than k
miles rare screw up honda
both gtz gsr flawed cars performance enthusiasts would take
 gtz cr purchase would gsr
