 has me thinking biological reason why women cant put
 keys pants pockets like men do i have two pockets 
 back each my pants i put my keys one wallent another
 many pockets even have botton them so i can close them securely
 everything much simpler me why cant women do same
 biological ie enough room bigger bottom plus keys 
 wallet way raised parents 

oh pulleeze

its biology all its clothing design womens clothing 
generally designed nonfunctional possible its only been
 last five years so you could buy womens pants 
pockets deep enough carry anything previously deep pockets were
virtually unknown womens clothing skirts generally have better
pockets now too dresses espcially fancy dresses still pretty
hopeless i often hand my drivers license over my husband were
dressed up go out somewhere so i dont have encumbered 
purse

 women consistently bought functional clothing boycotted 
manufacturers who refuse make functional womens clothing i think
manufacturers would tend bow market pressures theres
 interesting chapter susan faludis backlash described
what happened last time clothing manufacturers ignored 
need functional womens clothing manufactuing industry
lost millions

from woman who would rather buy mens clothing decent pockets 
long legs high waists than womens clothing without
