reason i ask because i went classic car meet here uk
 saw very nice old de soto s vintage id guess wooden
artillery type wheels etc righthand drive i cant believe
 desoto produced rhd cars just uk

well sweden australia lord knows wherever else used drive 
 wrong side road so export market might have been
larger than just uk

im guessing i believe twenties we probably drove mostly down
cattle trails wagon ruts i am fairly sure placement 
steering wheel pretty much arbitrary company time

 s very active good roads movement which had
its origins actually s during bicycle craze picked up
steam teens witness linclon highway association so
 us highway support act real name something different 
 first pledged federal aid states counties build decent
roads also experience widespread use trucks domestic
transport during ww convinced government good raods were
crucial our national defense anyway s were plenty
 good roads least around urban areas were rapidly
expanding countryside era after all 
first auto touring fad motel auto camp ground etc two good
books subject spring mind warren belasco america 
road title may exact author another called devil
wagon gods country author i forget also any john flinks 
john bell raes auto histories

 placement steering wheel being arbitrary early
teens were virtually american cars did have wheel
 left early days cars had wheel left 
right even middle well sometimes having tiller
instead wheel standardized fairly early though i
dont know why
