 turbo uk good mph useful blowing away vw beetles though i
believe beetle corners better 

i can say without any doubt i have never been blown away any volvo ever
ive been blocked few car parks though shithead volvo owners who only thought theyd few minutes does happen owners any other makes car

 sure how long small shitbox volvos last too damn long worst car i ever drove hired power handling ride reminiscent something
from s without character only ceased production couple years back ive only been passenger big volvos enough i ought go
 test drive because offer some neat gifts


oh well i have admit most disgusting feature 
volvos marketing looks like volvo uses something like
do you dare risk your family any car attitude which quite
annoying long run

 now volvo has produced new good car volvo front drive
 l valves motor completely new chassis etc even british magazine
car liked believe me quite much volvo 
 american magazine road track said your uncle
olofs car positive sense

 any case id still like own estate strong tanklike
chassis l inline six rear drive 

btw only car drivers who have blocked me land rover jaguar
drivers 

what you mean what i drive cheapo japanese toyota course
i do have money car like bmw merc jaguar saab 
volvo etc
 i had money i would have bad problems deciding which one
 buy
