 has me thinking biological reason why women cant put
 keys pants pockets like men do i have two pockets 
back each my pants i put my keys one wallent another
many pockets even have botton them so i can close them securely
everything much simpler me why cant women do same
 biological ie enough room bigger bottom plus keys 
 wallet way raised parents 

ive found has do way womens clothes made
 you put keys front pocket womens jeans slacks you
get bulge also tends make impossible sit down because
 stick you constantly ditto back pocket

also try looking back pockets womens jeans compare
them back pockets mens jeans usually you buy
jeans you expect last any length time about half 
size flat out isnt room wallet bunch keys

besides which where would men put all crap wives
didnt carry purses 

 same place single men do wallet back pocket comb other
back pocket keys front pocket knive other from pocket pen
 shirt pocket front pants pocket do married men start
carrying around bunch stuff keep women happy
