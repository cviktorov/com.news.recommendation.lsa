 your experience how true fuel injector cleaning
 do much more good than just using detergent gas while i
agree clogged fuel injector would darken my day how clogged
do get good price can i do myself buying
 can what doing what


 fuel injector cleaning dealer probably little more than
them opening your gas tank dumping bottle fuel injector cleaner
 sending you your merry way poorer go kmart buy 
cleaner yourself 

personally i wouldnt use product from kmart i knew about
 previously past weekend pbss motorweek pat goss 
 resident tech type discussed products recommends
 using them ie nonisopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners

supposedly only isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture
from your fuel tank clean your injectors although 
others ethyl based do clean injectors also cause rubber 
components fuel system deteriorate dont mix well
 water help remove from fuel system

i use product recommended vw called k bg products inc
 cost more about supposed do job without
 potential harmful side effects its results supposed 
last from k k miles i have also used chevrons techtrolene sp

i cant say i have noticed any difference using either since i 
only use product preventative maintenance item

 
just because you dealer sez you need dont mean its necessarily so
 suspicious
