while back i asked help defending traffic ticket i received
 short
 ticket stopping stop sign given conditions
 i could stop time decided instead sliding right through 
 intersection i would complete my rightturn avoid possible accident
 police cruiser happened approaching intersection from my left
 gave me ticket
 officer said only reason you even slowed down first
 place you saw me approaching otherwise you would have bombed right
 through


 i would like thank all those who responded favorably my request 
 help all those who told me bite bullet pay fine

 judge sided me decided case stopping 
 safest thing do found me guilty

 officers statement my account conditions time very
 slippery backed newpaper weather conditions were factors what made
 judge decide his verdict


 moral you have never been court before you think you have case
 go very interesting process 
 your benefit exercise your rights
