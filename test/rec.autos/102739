i had exactly same problem horizon third gear would
just disengage engine would rev up kind disconcerting

i sold car quite few years back memory tranny
sticks me also had clutch chatter first dealer
could fix lemon law had been place car
would have been covered

i have had several jap cars since figuring horizon my
contribution american auto companies have never seen any
bad behavior exception toyota tercel bit 
clutch chatter did fix first try

anyway from day forward i have sworn i would never
purchase another american car standard american manufacturers
dont have clue how manufacture five speed transmissions 
have been doing automatics much longer many more cars
however i hate automatics so i am still buying jap cars

 sure any help other cars do too
