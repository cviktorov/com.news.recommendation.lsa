 while taking extended easter vacation i going north i
 somewhere between centerville tx dallas tx i came upon 
 train parked trestle its locomotive sitting directly over
 northbound lanes appeared movement within cab 
 out curiosity i slowed get better look just i
 passed from underneath trestle my radar detector went full 
 alert all lights lit all chirps beeps buzzes going strong
 i thought i had been nailed good police materialized
 
 some all locomotives have doppler speedometers radar head 
 mounted looking down ground minimize intereference sent 
 received looking tangentally wheel low power units
 typically wont trigger radar detectors unless unusual situation
 yours arises
