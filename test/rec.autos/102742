i consulted someone working electronic odometer 
design use microprocessor based system write somewhat
ofuscated pattern eeprom idea make circuit
difficult program arbitrary values eeprom 
secondary purpose acutally primary purpose from standpoint
 practicality distributed writes so avoid
exceeing maximum number writes fof eeprom being used
 microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from hall effect
 rate any higher than mph so make spoofing reading
 bench pulsing least somewhat undesirable 
automobile expected ever exceed mph 
operation case course might same your
 rx

 ecm modules some cars do indeed store info about conditions
under which cars have been operated since steering angle 
velocity data etc available would difficult 
collect all sorts interesting demographic information about 
drivers use car i am aware any manufacturer
currently trying enforce warranty restrictions based reading
out use data from ecm while could potential invasion
 your privacy manufacturers have access data about your
driving style could also provide valuable information from
actual field use conditions help engineer more appropriate cars
i personally wouldnt mind dealer collecting my driving
demographics long done anonymous fashion
