im little new newsgroup i would like tap some 
knowledge expertise available here

 subject aftermarket cruise controls

 background
i recently broke my ankle roadbicycling accident places five 
screws yuk two weeks i returning texas my
home from my school byu provo utah you can imagine trying 
drive nearly miles broken right ankle isnt just epitome 
 good time my car does have cruise control so i would have do
all pedalling ha ha my messedup ankle

my question
what general opinion aftermarket cruise control units i
realize cheap cc cruise control from say pep boys isnt going 
 good factory professionally installed unit 
thing i uderstand i probably cant expect much way 
accuracy looks sort thing anythings gotta better than
trying drive hosed ankle

i have jeep cherokee speed standard l engine 
ketteringsp ignition yknow distributor cap rotor setupnot
electronic maybe you couldve guessed being im just trying
 give information completly i can

i found cc unit bucks seems use vehicles vacuum system 
instead electric servormotor good bad i did buy
 cc which vacuum hose should i tap

 has two speed sensors one magnetic one gets signal from 
negative side distributor kinda like tach pickup so i
understand i can use either one which best manual says i read
 store today magneticaxle setup more accurate 
harder install really big difference

 has sensor brake pedal just like other ccs does have 
sensor clutch pedal so i wasnt paying real close attention i
might push clutch while cruise trying get speed up which
would wind engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me turned 
 thing off im pretty coordinated so doesnt bother me 
were my girlfriends car would bother me im ok 

 installation also calls attachment steadyon brake signal
 switchedon brake signal i think i can get switched brake signal
from correct side brake light blade fuse am i right im
 sure where get steadyon brake signal matter what
exactly any ideas what manufaturer wants where get


i think i can figure other things out like how hookup negative
side tachtype sensing gizmo cabin control unit ground 
all miscellaneous business i need little help 

 worth money safety risk any 
 device
 any particularly good aftermarket cc
 professionally installed ccs signifacantly better 
 worth cabbage
 unit i saw sorry manufacturer model number just
 pep boy its sufficient my simple 
 needs how do i get thing installed properly specifically
 questions above

my father i built veep volkswagen powered jeep cja when i 
high school so i consider myself fairly good tools electronics 
cars so installation doesnt scare me i just want certain 
i get thing installed correctly my cherokee just wee bit more
complicated than my veep
