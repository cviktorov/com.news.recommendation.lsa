 after too many years school im finally graduating getting real
 job course i am trying make plans how spend all extra
 money right now i have accord good car real sporty 
 i thinking selling about two years dropping around
 k sports car some kind after thinking about i may have 
 better idea ill keep accord until drops buy car ive
 always wanted corvette stingray my reasoning accord
 corvette less than what i would spend anyway
 
 basically im thinking late s early s around k
 my question what good years consider reliability looks
 horsepower order believe horsepower main
 concern i want go fast i get my motorcycle what 
 good prices
 
 also what would insurance look like im male single i might
 wait until im get car lower insurance would fact 
 i mainly drive other car lower some type classic
 car rarely driven insurance class driving under k miles
 per year
 
 my dad has vette its what you say classic insurance
 basically what means has restricted amount driving
 time which basically means cant used every day car would
 probably suit your needs limited mileage
 


 addition restricted mileage many classic insurance carriers also require
 vehicle garaged when use
