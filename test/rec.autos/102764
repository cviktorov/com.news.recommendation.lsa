tire questions

q what do funny numbers sides my tires mean

 typically you see something like hr 
 overall width tire millimeters tread usually
 narrower aspect ratio indicates height 
 sidewall tire relative overall width our example tire
 has sidewall height mm wheel
 diameter inches also some special tires called trx
 tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like
 which millimeters r means radial h speed
 rating indicating highest speed which tire when properly
 inflated carrying appropriate load may safely operate common
 speed ratings s mph t mph h mph v up 
 mph

 recent changes method specifying tire sizes move speed
 rating different part designation you may therefore find
 designations like r h indicates pertire load
 associated speed rating exceeding load continuous
 operation rated speed dangerous practice what follows 
 table showing number load indices corresponding maximum
 pertire loads

 load index 
 max load kg 

 note usual mass vs weight confusion occurs table

 some cases letters p lt may found front tire
 size lt designation indicates light truck p designation
 indicates passenger car letter given application
 tire passenger car usage far i know letters
 only appear us market lt designation prinicipally 
 interest owners light trucks other utility vehicles 
 owner passenger vehicle meaningful difference
 between tire p designation one designation 
 all

 aspect ratio omitted probably may 

 tires ms mudsnow designation may have speed rating
 reduced kmh about mph

 additional set ratings tires temperature
 traction treadwear temperature traction graded
 b c best c worst treadwear 
 numeric rating values limited value 
 assigned somewhat arbitrarily tire manufacturers 
 thus useful comparing different brands tires

q my car has tires funny size designation hr can i put
 normal tires car

 your tires called trx tires were devised michelin
 because somewhat different bead design incompatible
 normal tires michelin used different diameter wheel them
 so could mounted wrong type wheel so 
 more conventional tires could mounted trx type wheels
 you need aquire different wheels put normal tire your
 car barely possible fit normal tires trx wheels horribly
 dangerous do so tires may simply peel off rims corner
 possibly blow out high speed trx type tires becoming hard
 find addition michelin avon makes suitable tires goodyear
 has apparently discontinued line trx tires

q can i rotate radials from side side rotate them only one side
 my car

 car tire manufacturers have differing views subject many
 say swapping radials between left right hand sides 
 car now ok group includes michelin goodyear others
 example pirelli nokia void warranties swapping
 done best advice read your tire manual carefully before
 rotating your tires stick manufacturers recommendations

q how many snow tires should i buy i buy which end 
 car should i put them 

 short both ends explain many drivers areas dont
 get excessive snow who dont drive agressively all snow
 conditions get away only two snows drive wheels 
 circumstances where can dangerous practice rear
 wheel drive car you can choose between being able start car
 going function rear axle stopping turning car
 function front axle front wheel drive car you start
 stop turn front end primary risk putting 
 snow tires front only you have put brakes
 while going downhill you run serious risk going downhill backwards

safety equipment

q do airbags really work

 preliminary statistics suggest following airbags work much
 better than belts good point belts alone work much better than
 airbags alone airbags point belts work slightly better than
 point belts alone con airbags some designs tend
 burn drivers hands when venting byproducts 
 explosion occurs inside bag some designs 
 all may knock drivers hands from wheel making retention
 control vehicle after bag deflates more difficult

brake questions

q do i always need get rotors my disk brakes turned midas
 always wants do 

 specific conditions mandate turning replacing
 rotors some shops try make little extra money replacing rotors
 more often than strictly necessary rotors warped
 warped only lightly grooved need replace 
 turn them note also some rotors rotors many hondas
 good example so narrow begin practical
 turn them must replaced when become too thin warped
 badly grooved

q tell me i should downshift when braking slow my car down 
 really good idea

 used very good idea back days mediocre fade
 prone drum brakes modern disc brake equipped cars use 
 downshifting slow car really necessary except cases
 long steep downhill runs otherwise modern disc brakes more
 than adequate stop passenger car all circumstances 
 much cheaper repair than clutch linings

 other hand many standard drivers license tests usa
 still specify driver being tested downshift under braking i
 suggest before taking us drivers test you either learn 
 do smoothly which takes some time practice borrow 
 car automatic take test

q how often should i replace my brake fluid

 probably more often than you do traditional brake fluids tend 
 absorb water water can corrode internal parts brake
 system also lower boiling point fluid dot type
 older fluids dot dot newer specifications 
 principal differences wet dry boiling points dry
 boiling point important fresh brake fluid wet boiling
 point important older brake fluid dot fluids have lowest
 wet dry boiling point requirements dot fluids have better
 boiling point requirements dot fluids have best boiling
 point requirements dot fluids clearly superior see
 next qa more details while requirements imply 
 dot fluids better than dot fluids may specific
 cases where dot fluid preferable mostly
 competition applications otherwise dot type fluids offer much
 improved brake pedal feel replacement once year recommended 
 dot fluids although agressive drivers may profit changing out
 fluid more frequently least bleeding modest amount fluid
 out brake calipers fairly regularly

q what about dot brake fluids

 breaks down two parts dot specification looks
 excellent performance first dot fluids were silicone
 based silicone fluids tricky proposition unlike dot 
 dot fluids do absorb water all while may sound
 like feature problem any water present pools up 
 systems interfering braking performance corroding any
 metals spot where pooling occuring water tend
 migrate downwards braking system brake calipers where
 most corrosion occurs

 because phenomenon essential when converting 
 silicone empty entire brake system flush throughly
 beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts 
 brake system when converting silicone fluids

 two other issues come up silicone fluids 
 difficult pour cleanly without air bubbles which
 interferes getting good brake pedal feel while 
 generally have much higher boiling points than dot fluids 
 do have high temperature failure modes which indistinguishable
 effect from boiling dot fluids silicone fluids may make sense
 some street car applications certainly 
 recommended high performance driving applications 
 economics questionable street use

 i have recently become aware new fluids meet dot standard
 do contain silicones fluids appear reasonably
 compatible older dot dot fluids i have little
 information time

q abs available some cars im looking costs
 more worth 

 does have cut dried answer therefore answer 
 quite long order cover pros cons short answer
 abs costs more both initially maintain generally
 work better average driver say driver who does
 have extensive experience high performance driving techniques
 may require unlearning some obsolete braking techniques
 like pump braking which should unlearned any case

 now long answer abs works monitering wheels 
 car looking signs locked brakes may may able
 able distinguish between different wheels several
 systems market cannot detect impending lockup which 
 what you would really want ideal world only existence
 lockup sensors used vary some less well designed
 sensors sensitive tire size brake pad material 
 may cease function properly owner deviates from original
 equipment oeequivalent components

 when sensors detect lockup abs system responds unlocking
 brakes either individually all once depending 
 system driver keeps foot firmly planted abs
 end up cycling between locked unlocked states 
 sensor existed could detect impending lockup we could
 sit right point which where maximum braking effect 
 achieved pulsing can often felt brake pedal 
 system cycles percentage time brakes 
 truly engaged called duty cycle typically abs system
 about dry pavement trained driver can beat 
 duty cycle quite reliably using technique called threshold braking
 wet pavement braking so chancy abs outperform
 threshold braking nearly every time unfortunately mud 
 snow often maximum braking effect can acheived brakes
 locked only audi manufacturers producing absequipped cars
 has seen fit provide disable switch abs system 
 eventuality

 particularly important feature abs preserves
 steering control case simply because you 
 braking near limit turn wheel abs release
 brakes sees steeringtriggered lockup back off
 percentage time brakes applied
 braking distances lengthen accordingly

 important caution abs cannot exceed maximum theoretical
 braking force any given situation you start sliding 
 glare ice dont expect abs system help you out very much
 coefficient friction changed presence 
 abs system your car

 far maintenence goes addition potential
 restrictions ive listed above you have worry about 
 following parts costs much higher oe master cylinder
 my obscure european sedan lists oe master
 cylinder absequipped version same car lists 
 over most manufacturers explicitly forbid use dot
 silicone brake fluids absequipped vehicles because 
 potential cost replacement corroded brake system
 components regular i suggest annual replacement brake fluid
 becomes very important

q what about threshold braking business

 normally id put consumers qa recent
 publicity about number accidents involving police drivers
 absequipped chevy caprices suggests section 
 needed here rpw

 threshold braking technique practiced all serious high
 performance drivers made habit replaces stab
 pedal lock em up panic habit entirely much
 prefered basically premise tires generate
 maximum braking force when have just started slide 
 just before wheels lock up entirely drivers who threshold
 brake learn feel what threshold feels like learn
 search hit application brake
 pedal many cars you can feel you near 
 threshold when pedal starts firm up you depress 
 any case you cant hear tires whine just bit youre
 very near threshold

 car abs often twinge pedal just
 before system starts cycling driver backs off 
 pedal just tad when twinge felt very
 close threshold theyll probably achieve better
 stopping distances than just punched let abs
 take over

 recently has been rash publicity over number 
 accidents one death involving police cars equipped 
 abs systems police departments question quickly blamed
 new abs systems according autoweek magazine now
 seems clear problem lack training none 
 involved officers had any recent performance driving training
 reason believe drivers reacted pulsing
 brake pedal pump braking old discredited technique
 stabbing releasing brake pedal goal being 
 try get brakes back failing hydraulic system you
 think about minute youll realize pump braking must
 cut effective operation working brake system least
 so you cut duty cycle abs system 
 much you giving up most your brakes wrong reason
 threshold braking has advantage effective
 useful technique regardless whether your car has abs 
 you do fear failed hydraulic system one two stabs 
 pedal sufficient 

gas questions

q does high octane gasoline help

 maybe maybe some cars have knock sensors can adjust 
 engine timing turbocharger boost suit gasoline being used
 most cars however you should use cheapest gas makes your
 car run well check your owners manual details what your car
 needs

q my car made leaded gasoline unleaded gas hurt 

 possible unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear
 although amoco oil company argues otherwise actual increase
 valve wear almost unnoticeable however modern leaded
 gasolines actually contain very little lead you should however
 check your owners manual many cars from early s do 
 actually require leaded gasoline

q do fuel treatments help what kind should i use

 some do some dont during winter good idea use
 dry gas however some may harmful fuel injection systems
 never use additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl
 alcohol additives may damage fuel systems cars carbs
 almost certainly damage cars fuel injection

 manufacturers opinions vary additives containing ethanol sometimes
 called ethyl alcohol your car has fuel injection check owners
 manual your car before using most manufacturers consider
 ethanol acceptable gasoline additives isopropyl alcohol
 isopropanol petroleum distillates fine fuel injected
 cars

 occasional bottle fuel injector cleaner helpful cars 
 fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents 
 do same job some off brands fuel injector cleaners contain
 ethanol methanol always check ingredients before putting anything
 your gas tank

 small number particularly good additives 
 noticeably more expensive runofthemill ones work
 much much better among chevron techron redline sl
 wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber bg k bottle one 
 once every six months highly recommended

q what about detergent gasolines

 quality detergent packages gasolines varies somewhat bmw
 has instituted testing program gasoline brands which pass 
 test may advertise fact stickers indicating passage test
 now beginning appear fuel pumps gas stations 
 gasolines used fuel injector cleaners probably optional
 beforewarned while use bmw approved gasolines keep clean
 engine clean may clean motor bad valve deposits

lubrication questions

q what do numbers letters motor oil designation mean

 several different items encoded twoletter
 code indicating type detergent package manufacturer
 uses oil looks like sesfcd s codes 
 gasoline engine applications c codes diesel engine
 applications second letter assigned sequence new levels
 protection developed thus sf considered better than se
 se considered better than sd so forth

 more noticeable designation oil weight either
 single number eg weight pair numbers separated 
 letter w eg w latter type much more commonly
 used days only type most automobile
 manufacturers specify operators manuals first number 
 designation w apparent viscosity oil when cold
 w stands winter second number viscosity
 oil when hot trick here oil doesnt actually
 get thicker turn from weight weight gets hotter what
 actually happening when oil cold has viscosity
 cold weight oil gets hotter doesnt get thin fast
 w oil would time up temperature has 
 viscosity hot weight oil

 note numbers actually specify ranges viscosities 
 all w oils have exactly same viscosity when cold all
 weight oils have same viscosity when hot note also 
 novel behaviour multigrade oils caused additives has
 been reported sole exception castrol gtx w oils
 do retain multigrade characteristics well over time w
 w w oils work very well though

q quick lube places any good

 some do adequate work quite few incompetent ones out
 let buyer beware watch them while work make sure
 dont overtorque oil drain plug keep your hand 
 your wallet all times

q oil additives like slick tufoil any good

 slick tufoil ptfebased additives many have
 come onto market recently different from molybased
 additives have been around since early s ptfe 
 chemical name teflontm trademark owned dupont general
 auto manufacturers do recommend use products most usenet
 responses questions additives favorable slight
 increase mpg after application smoother revving long term
 results whether ptfe additives effective after k miles 
 debatable some manufacturers saab claim either 
 product engine flush preceeds application causes
 deterioration oil seals eventual leakage some bmw owners
 have reported death valve seals shortly after addition 
 slick cars writer has been cautioned slick
 dealer slick should used japanese motors 
 may clog oil return passages engine otherwise 
 known reports damage caused ptfe additives

 other hand satified slick customers world

q do synthetic oils really work

 yes more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics
 disagree extremely long oil change intervals claimed 
 oil manufacturers auto manufacturers recommend you continue 
 change oil intervals recommended owners manual your
 car even you decide try longer intervals least change
 oil filter regular intervals synthetics get just dirty
 conventional oils

 synthetic gear lubricants manual transmissions another matter
 entirely amsoil redline agip very highly regarded very
 effective mobil synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however

q manufacturers specifying longer longer oil change intervals
 how often should i change my oil

 depends how you drive your car always nearly always
 gets warmed up you dont drive very hard keep revs
 down manufacturers recommendation probably fine however
 you drive hard drive high revs alternatively you
 only drive from supermarket so doesnt get up
 temperature you may wish change oil much more often
 perhaps mile intervals given most manufacturers 
 now specifying mile intervals you dont drive your car
 much all say miles year you probably want change
 oil every six months anyway you storing car during winter
 change oil before storing change oil when you bring out
 storage

misc questions

q my car has timing belt i hear bad things happen when 
 break whats story

 depends internal design motor early ford escorts
 example suffer severe valve damage belt breaks 
 newer cars just require tow installation new belt
 some honda motors damaged others 

 replacement interval specified your car change 
 belt least every miles some cars may require more frequent
 replacement ask your dealer independent mechanic also ask 
 any related repairs should take place same time
 example same ford escorts suffer valve damage also have
 timing belt driven water pump which has been known seize
 destroying timing belt which causes major valve damage
 side effect replacing timing belt while ignoring water
 pump can costly mistake

q why would anyone stupid enough design motor so 
 self destructs when timing belt breaks

 performance reasons compromising piston design so 
 valves pistons collide requires compression
 ratio engine reduced significantly why you 
 more likely avoid valve damage economy cars than performance
 oriented vehicles

q what causes unintended acceleration

 final report national highway transportation safety
 administration concluded unintended acceleration could 
 caused any mechanical failure vehicle question 
 same time consistent physical evidence nhtsa report
 goes conclude pedal misapplication vehicle operator
 probably cause
