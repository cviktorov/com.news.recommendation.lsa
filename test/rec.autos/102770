 commonly asked questions

radar questions

q where radar detectors illegal

 us currently virgina district columbia prohibit
 all usage radar detectors new york prohibits use 
 large trucks canada illegal manitoba ontario
 quebec newfoundland pei prince edward island 
 apparently illegal through most all europe
 legislation which would make them illegal pending many other
 jurisdictions chances legislation passing varies great deal

q where radar detector detectors used do really work

 usage spreading rapidly initially were used only canada
 now appearing new york virginia unsafe
 assume use connecticut dc
 work detecting certain frequency radiated many currently
 available super het radar detectors some brands detector radiate
 more strongly than others thus more likely spotted
 new radar detectors becoming available which may detected
 current generation detector detectors note 
 detector may only spotted one devices turned
 

q what vascar some kind radar

 vascar nothing more than fancy stopwatch timespeeddistance
 computer depends operator pressing buttons target
 vehicle passes landmarks radar signals emitted vascar
 system

q what ka band radar where used should radar detector 
 able handle 

 ka band has recently been made available fcc use us
 socalled photoradar installations installations 
 lowpowered beam aimed across road degree angle 
 direction traffic picture taken vehicles which 
 radar unit determines have been violation speed limit
 tickets mailed owner vehicle because low
 power degree angle many people believe radar
 detector cannot give reasonable warning ka band radar unit
 although some manufacturers radar detectors have added 
 capability anyway number locales where photoradar use
 limited some question legality units best advice
 learn what photo radar units look like keep track where 
 used else dont speed

q do radar jammers work legal

 quick answer usa
 detailed answer cheap radar jammers do work well all
 jammers work expensive usually property 
 military jammers major violation regulations 
 federal communications commission usa

driving technique vehicle dynamics questions

q what understeer oversteer

 understeer oversteer terms describing behaviour 
 car while cornering near limit limit adhesion 
 most drivers do normally drive hard enough terms 
 descriptive situations encounter simply put 
 tell whether car wants go straight corner steer less
 understeer wants turn more corner oversteer
 understeer commonly designed most production cars so 
 untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast wont get 
 trouble understeer may also induced using too much throttle
 corner oversteer designed some more performance
 oriented cars may induced lifting throttle trailing
 throttle oversteer tto extreme cases lifting throttle
 may induce so much oversteer car reacts fishtailing 
 spinning

 some technical details corner speed tires car
 develop what called slip angles slip angle 
 angular difference between direction car traveling
 direction steering wheel directing car 
 travel understeer front wheels have greater slip angle
 than rear wheels oversteer rear wheels have greater
 slip angle than front wheels

q what revmatched downshift

 when downshifting engine must rotating faster lower gear
 than higher gear however during downshift normally
 you declutch lift your foot from throttle so revs drop
 rather than increase revmatched downshift you blip throttle
 before reengaging clutch so engine already up 
 new speed results much smoother faster downshift

q what does heelandtoe mean

 heelandtoe technique used do revmatched downshift while
 braking normally challenging because you need right foot
 both brake throttle called heelandtoe because you
 use one end foot brake other throttle 
 match revs downshift many modern cars misnomer
 often you must use ball foot brake right side
 throttle

 note some race car drivers skip clutch just use 
 left foot brake right foot throttle accomplishing
 same thing

q what doubleclutch downshifting

 while your right foot doing above your left foot can do one 
 three things nothing declutch once declutch twice reason 
 declutching twice match speeds two shafts 
 transmission speed engine usually coupled 
 revmatching so while engine neutral clutch
 engaged throttle blipped both shafts transmission
 speed up

 procedure follows
 declutch
 move gearshift lever neutral
 engage clutch
 match revs
 declutch
 move gearshift lever next lower gear
 engage clutch

 sounds like lot work practice becomes natural
 problem doubleclutching solves normally function 
 synchronizers within gearbox transmissions without synchros 
 very worn synchros doubleclutching makes much easier shift
 basically you doubleclutch well you using synchros 
 all generally unnecessary street cars synchros good
 condition

q what do numbers acceleration from mile skidpad 
 slalom times auto magazines really mean may compared

 short much magazines want you believe 
 almost never

 more detail acceleration numbers mph mile times
 us may vaguely compared long all come from 
 same source testing procedures vary so much from magazine magazine
 comparing road track number car driver number quite
 pointless keep mind too same variation applies from
 driver driver street driver major often 
 major part equation

 skidpads vary even didnt skidpad figures really
 only tests stickiness stock tires change radically
 when tire compounds change do make any assumptions about 
 comparative handling say two sports sedans based skidpad numbers
 suggest skidpads without value however skidpads
 excellent educational tool driving schools simply
 limited value comparison anything except tires

 slalom times slightly more useful test some small parts 
 automobiles transient response however also heavily influenced
 stock rubber car do test many corners 
 cars envelope do tell you all you need know before making
 buying decision example dont tell you what rear end
 car do road which suddenly goes offcamber when car
 has adjustable suspension tests usually done sport
 setting which may quite unsuitable daily driving list 
 caveats could go page after page

q my buddy claims wide tires dont make any difference according
 his freshman physics textbook you cant ever accelerate
 corner more than g does he know what hes talking about

 short he hasnt got clue

 more detail equations friction used freshman physics
 textbooks presume surfaces smooth dry nondeformable
 none which properly apply tire traction except case 
 stone cold tire dry pavement which far below its proper operating
 temperature

 pavement never smooth always irregular greater lesser
 extent tires which really dry solid rubber 
 substance which its natural form liquid which has only been
 coerced semblance solidity chemical magic deform match
 surface pavement which vehicle traveling over tire
 operating temperature grip actually generated shear stresses
 inside deformed rubber anything even remotely resembling
 friction freshman physics sense term colder tire
 relative its operating temperature closer its behaviour 
 traditional concept friction much hotter than its
 proper operating temperature more likely possibility some
 part tire actually reverting liquid which mostly like
 happen deep tread causing characteristic blisters chunking
 latter though almost completely unlikely happen normal
 street driving so unless youre competition driver do lot 
 high speed track driving dont worry about 

 because tire traction completely out domain simple friction
 does obey freshman physics equation all thus dragsters
 accelerate more than g race cars corner brake more than
 g because simple friction does apply actually possible
 different sized contact patches generate differing amounts 
 grip actual analysis tire behavior would require techniques
 finite element analysis due complexity mechanism

q what does name acronym stand 

 here list some names which commonly asked
 about careful soliciting meanings other names
 misinformation abounds net particular never
 ask rechumor you want useful result

q does vw own porsche

 porsche publicly held company controlled porsche 
 piech families porsche has extensive business dealings vwaudi
 which causes some confusion since currently porsche some
 financial difficulty possibility mercedes vw may
 interested purchasing company near future 
 only speculation time
