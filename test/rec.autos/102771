many people want set up mailing lists favorite
automotive topics rather fewer know how do article
 provide essential information doing so standard
unix systems shell script examples alias file setups
 included which presently run sparc here balltowncmacom
 number mailing lists note you do set up automotive
mailing list please let me know request address so i can
list montly recautos posting also inform keeper 
usenet listoflists check newsanswers monthly posting

first all get anywhere you need either sysadmin
 have some measure assistance from your sysadmin also
important you have reasonably good network connectivity seems
like you get everything several days after anyone else you
have trouble getting email through your network connectivity 
probably good enough

listserv

 handy automated mailing list package named listserv which
 available from several ftp servers network details 
 installation operation listserv beyond scope 
article anyone who considering running large mailing list should
probably look listserv carefully

 alias file

 typical unix system file named usrlibaliases 
whichever file server your mail host contains lines 

foo bar baz bletch


which means any email sent name foo host 
redistributed users bar baz bletch thus simplest
possible email list 

myfavoritecar member member member myaddress
myfavoritecarrequest myaddress

 has couple problems most noticeable one being 
you have superuser edit alias file however you can
do following connivance your sysadmin

myfavoritecar includehomemydirmiscautosmyfavoritecarlist
myfavoritecarrequest myaddress

where file specified list comma newline separated
addresses file can list admins home directory
owned list admin

bounced mail

 still has problem bounced mail usually gets distributed all 
members list which generally considered somewhat irritating
therefore way driving school mailing list set up
 instructive thanks harpal chohan bmw list setup
 way im sure where he got from


schoolrequest welty
schoolrebroadcast includehomenewweltymiscautosschoollist
school usrlocaladmbinexplscript school
ownerschool schoolrequest
ownerschoolout schoolrequest


heres what going here

 owner request addresses intended traps bounced mail
coming from network request address also serves point
 contact administrative duties

school what people send mail instead pointing addresses
 points shell script which rewrites headers before resending
 email schoolbroadcast which nobody except me knows name
 name has been changed here protect my own sanity points 
actual list members

 shell script i use follows


binsh
cd tmp
sed e replytod e senderd e from d 
 echo replyto balltowncmacom 
 echo errorsto requestballtowncmacom 
 echo sender requestballtowncmacom 
 cat 
 usrlibsendmail om f requestballtowncmacom 
 f mailing list rebroadcast
exit 


note script does know name list name
 passed from outside so script may used multiple
lists i run several out site
 script excises replyto sender from lines from incoming
message substitutes sender replyto adds errorsto
 all email bounce messages end up being sent request
 owner addresses header rewrite done

 digested lists some digestification software around
hopefully ill able provide more information future version
