bzzzt wrong answer really depends whether you talking model
year date manufacture instance mine 
manufactured august prior all s were o liter 
 model years were liter 
model years were liter except carerra rs which 
 liter later years were easily identified new mph
bumpers most models year were lietsr except carerra
rsr which liter us carerras from were liter models 
 went liter only single model sc think
 cross between s carerra models note all above
 based model year date manufacture 

i stand corrected all from memory mind you 

 rev happy behavior earlier cars even more prone 
 liter cars used low compression engines suffered bit
 regard early liter liter engines also got good
dose smog gear well liter engines were far away
 quickest revvers lot 

yeah thats what i trying say really
