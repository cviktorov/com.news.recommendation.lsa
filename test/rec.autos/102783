bargain you get frustrated somebody delaying your inevitable death 
due less wise driving practices tough

well i never wrote i would act you described i stated i 
would block wouldbe passer i would block wouldbe passer
 own good any reason other than i prevented from 
doing so due traffic circumstance i fail see how deterring 
passer under circumstance would any way decrease your chances
 being involved accident fatal otherwise fact i could
imagine how blocking wouldbe passer would actually increase your 
chances being offed involved accident especially 
 passer riding your bumper intentionally blocking person
riding your bumper certainly wise driving practice 
only causes jam become more congested 
 
i dont mess trucks i actually watch road ahead 
road behind i perceive i am rapidly closing pack 
 vehicles i try avoid getting caught up situation you 
decribe usually either traffic just building i have deal 
 fact life i wait slow passer complete 
pass make way pack clear someone decides 
pull up my bumper i signal my intention move right 
do so first opportunity hope open jam i 
feel only courteous driving alot safer than 
actions you advocate actually many courteous drivers 
 road who do intentionally impede others 

 someone front me seems oblivious fact 
 blocking traffic i use my blinker flash my lights all 
else fails briefly speed up slow down so might get 
message i am faster vehicle trying pass i feel never 
safe ride anyones bumper someone intentionally blocking 
traffic because feel civil duty philosophic duty 
 some unfathomable reason i feel deserve very least
derision sorry soooooooo long
