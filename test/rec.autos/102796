im wondering anybody else out clutchless shifter ive been
doing my self over miles my current toyota truck ive got
over k ive heard people talk about how doing can damage 
transmission my experiences suggest otherwise what techniques do you use

yeah i dont use clutch all time either ive done 
 fords bmw datsun chevy works fine i cant think 
any reason would damage tranny essentially you just
doing what synchros do anyhow match engine speed 
tranny speed slip gear


 some old pieces junk i drove transmission so
worn pumping clutch only way shift except clutchless
 date ive driven rabbits datsuns comets fords chevy some where
harder than others shift generally higher milage smoother
quicker easier where shift

my technique ease back off throttle same time gently
wrist back shift lever some reason i miss shift window
i lightly press accelerator try agian ive found clutchless
shifting eaiserquicker high rpms i also skip gears some
times using 

sounds about right i usually slip out during throttledown
 blip throttle wait until feels like things right
usually about second slip gear
