hey nissan why arent you guys making any station wagons you used
 make wagon every platform sentra stanza maxima now
none all

 fact make some just dont sell them here us

sunny california l wagon based sentra
avenil l wdwd wagon looks like infinity g 
 actually its independently designed wagoni mean its 
 based any sedans 
 
nissan had better consider sell them here

after buying my ser really loving i would like buy another
nissan product my wife prefer wagon ive owned minivans
 dont prefer them

how about altima wagon sentra wagon would do

sounds nice i doubt have plan coz avenil introduced 
 replace any sedan based wagon

 heres even better suggestion why dont you guys go ahead 
buy rest fuji heavy industries subaru put either 
inline v legacy wd wagon id buy legacy 
minute had nissan engine instead horizontal 
seem sentimentally attached 

 all camry accord taurus volvo subaru wagons out 
 its got market segment would worthwhile

i can wait year two you dont have something compete
 model i may have go elsewhere

thanks
