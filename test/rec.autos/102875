i deleted your name because i dont want sound accusative my remark
 
 twosided problem unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time
 breeding lowlifes getting worse our justice system best
 extremely weak handle problems why lowabiding citizens should have
 power protect themselves property using deadly force necessary 
 anywhere threat imminent
 
 my camaro my pride joy got stolen right out my driveway few years back
 persons did were eventually caught lucky me before
 having trashed car
 
 another occasion my way from texas florida i had stopped small motel
 night small town somewhere florida about youths were disturbing my
 car setting off alarm challenging me come out when i another tenant
 walked out magnum automatic respectively vanished 
 needless say i immediately packedup left
 
 watch out carjacking staged accidents can deadly
 
im going argue issue carrying weapons i would ask you 
you would have thought seriously about shooting kid setting off your
alarm i can think worse things world glad you got out 
before did anything give you reason fire your gun

we can all ask whats happening society days dont forget 
ask another important question too what effort am i expending make any
different than 

just my thoughts
