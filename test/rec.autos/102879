dont know she has any permanent damage though just case anybody 
concerned


what hell happening great country ours i
can see boyhood pranks peeing off bridges 
 pound rocks has our society really stooped low

erik velapold

 people start forcing others take responsibility actions
things like wouldnt happen untill we stop blaming outside causes 
start blaming criminals we continue let things like happen
