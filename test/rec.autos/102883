yes i have same questions what makes me upset r costs 
skyrocketing fact cant bought anymore my area also yet
another way mechanics dealers can ripoff customers also i reading
 new refrigerant compatible r system 
would cost upto retrofit car old r system
although important consider environment i think sudden ban 
 slap face consumer why consumer should have
 pay retrofit auto companies should have seen coming also
why governments world were so quick banning freon use
 yet so slow banning gasoline my opinion gasoline just 
hazardous anything else why cant start proposing bans 
switch natural gas electric technology hopefully some
chemist come up another alternative coolant compatible
 old system
al h

several chemists already have come up several substitutes 
r you dont hear about them because mobile air conditioning society
macs people who stand rake per
retrofit per automobile have mounted organized campaign squash those
r substitutes out existence ban them altogether very shaky
technical grounds best outright lies worst

your senator president epa dot complain
