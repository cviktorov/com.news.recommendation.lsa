how hard carb rebuild moderately experienced backyard mechanic
ive done my clutch miscellaneous little engine fixes

 hardest part usually getting darned thing off intake
manifold rebuilding carb fun youre things 
lots little parts i used rebuild them all my friends
cars high school so doesnt take phd buy carb rebuilding
kit from auto supply store buy gallon best carb cleaning
solvent you can find do still make tyme rule thumb
buy one scariest warning labels put metal
bucket make yourself dipping can punching holes bottom 
 coffee can attaching wire handle carb cleaner
doesnt strip paint right off coffee can youre 
using right stuff use can soak little stuff 
just hang big parts from coat hanger wash them off 
garden hose wipe off excess water paper towels air dry
 remember where all little parts go follow rebuild
kits instructions concerning float height choke tension etc
bolt back engine admire superclean carb 
filthy engine

heed mans warnings you get carb cleaner strong 
your hands your hands eaten away pretty hence dipping
