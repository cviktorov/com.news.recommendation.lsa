however i were design bmws electronics i use counter 
count number times car passed million miles whatever 
store car computers memory could read when doing 
diagnostics test ditto date odometer easy i 
dont know why manafucturers dont do dont prevent illegal 
odometer tampering

 previous writer said any case take aeons reset 
odometer mechanic electronic simulating driving car 
easier reprogram how i dont know

 shouldnt hard you know much about digital electronics 
counter made standard ttl chips all you should need do find
 chips used counting figure out what mileage you want put 
 preset wiring preset pins directly lowhigh youd also have
 know what conventions low high might little more
involved than shouldnt beyond someone bsee bs eet
all display does convert what counter chips say digits using
 translation table stored rom

 those chips probably inside custom chip make smaller 
use less power presetdata pins going available
 would probably ttl might cmos 
wider operating voltage range tecnology would make 
much difference
plus custom chip would probably potted encapsulated epoxy
good luck
