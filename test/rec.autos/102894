 problem i wasnt giving them any more money finance guy 
brought manager duty who proceeded give me hard time i 
reminded him i customer i didnt think i should 
treated like he didnt back off he could forget whole 
deal he made some smart remark so i told him where he could stick 
snatched back my check left needless say were pleased 
 turn events

thats nothing when friend mine went shopping small
sedan few years ago she brought me along token male so
 salespeople wouldnt give her bimbo treatment
her first choice mazda second choice nissan
sentra we went mazda dealership described what we
wanted we started negotiating price salesdroid
kept playing let me run price sales manager after
playing good salesman bad salesman game we finally told him
 he didnt have authority negotiate price perhaps
we should speaking directly someone who did he brought 
 sales manager who proceeded dick us around every trick
 book read remar suttons dont get taken every time 
list finally after playing few more rounds youll have 
work us price also known each time you come up 
thousand dollars well come down ten salesmanager gave signal 
his two sales cronies stood up said well we cant come down any
more so i guess we cant help you trouped out room
leaving us sitting salesmans office all ourselves hmm
id read sleazy salesmen sometimes bug own offices so 
can leave listen couples discussing sales offer 
i mentioned aloud my friend while we were sitting wondering
why would leave us office instead showing us 
door lack anything better do i picked up phone 
 desk called another mazda dealership asked salesman
 began discussing what kind price would consider few
sentences conversation mr salesmanager broke line
 began telling me how rude he thought i would call
another dealership from his phone i said since hed announced
 our business over he shouldnt care every time i tried
 talk other sales guy sales manager would drown out our
voices his own how did he know i using phone
anyway finally i hung up we headed out showroom
sales manager cronies come out little unmarked room he
begins berate us again we say we wont bother him anymore
were going next door nissan dealership

 comes part i wish i could have videotaped we go out
 front door sales manager shouts across entire showroom
customers all go ahead you deserve buy nissan
so my friend bought sentra

sales managers name gary tusone from his manner his
refusal come down reasonable price his anger 
end my guess he had bet our original salesman who 
 young novice hed able get least x dollars out
