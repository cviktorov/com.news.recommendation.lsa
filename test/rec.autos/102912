i dont know about trains ive saw sign back 
greyhound bus warns you your radar detector may set off
 doesnt explain why does set off my radar detector

because greyhound has apparently gotten around installing 
radar collisionprevention system use radar monitor how close
other vehicles how fast relative speeds signals
 warning driver theyre coming up something too fast
 getting too close

 all i remember from news reports few months back 
 time were only talking about possibility installing
 system didnt mention how worked bumpertobumper
traffic how discriminated between camaro approaching 
mph ye olde bridge support median being approached 
 mph curve

i do recall something about progressive stages warnings from
flashing lights audible warningsie goes from red too
close light hysterically screaming were all going die
