hi maybe someone can help me here
i am looking buy nissan maxima gxe cdn right now

so its automatic dont know us speccdn spec maximas

 car has km about miles 
 typical mileage cars seem about km about k mi
 seller just informed me when he brought car certification
he told front break pads exhausts had replaced
 meet legal standards he said he replace components before
selling car me

being copmletely ignorant technical stuff cars i dont know
what could mean
 k km about time typical replacing above mentioned items
 indication car abused

 first set brake pads front fine my car
eats set every k miles so fact he replacing 
muffler too also ok

would other things break down have replaced soon

 mileage fairly low typical fwd stuff cv joints check
 maintenance records manufacturers requirements valve
adjustments timing belt changes so 

 k mile service often expensive so make sure he has done everything


 seller told me he used car highway lot 
i dont know how verify ive seen paint chipped away
 tiny dots front edge hood though

well one commonly cited methods identifying 
car highway miles 
might check gas pedal wear too ask him how many sets tires he
has been through highway car might have squeezed sets
 hard driven car sets


although maxima excellent car car very clean 
well kept its currently out warranty
 similarly priced accord k km have years k km
worth warranty left i dont want worry about paying 
any repair bills

well maxima should pretty reliable its out warranty
you should get checked out someone knowledgeable first stuff
 japanese cars can expensive

 i also need car people 

when new maxima come out way

 model year i believe 

i would very much appreciate your input 
please reply email preferred post newsgroup

craig
thanks

ryan
