i have found kit advertised lowering front end early 
mustang installation envolves moving upper aarm installation 
 wedge shaped spacer between aarm ball joint apparently 
shelby mustangs did similair modification left out spacer

i would interested feedback pro con modification

im mustang head dont early ones have simple
strut suspension upper aarm just strut
going down lower control arm single bushing aarm 
tensioncompression rod locating forwardbackward direction

anyway simple strut suspensions like can lowered just using
shorter springs cutting springs lowering spring perch shortening
 strut below perch each cases suspension geometry
 suffer because lower control arms 
intended angle spacer placed between control arm bottom
 strut roughly height reduction restore
 suspension geometry imho kit includes spacer
 only way go
