how do i square respectable resale value easy its expensive
 buy new its gonna expensive buy used

 patently false statement try logic alfa fact 
marketplace has wonderufl mechanism adjust value cars 
 overpriced manufacturer expensive buy new 
necessarily expnesive buy used fact could real cheap buy 
used depending what car course note i do question your 
statements reliability wrangler i have never owned one driven one 
 been one i do love have one though


 what i dont understand why 
 apparent neglect quality so many years has filtered down 
 used marketis jeep so intoxicating so irresistable so seductive 
 make its purchase fatal attraction

yep popular vehicles you dont see lot previous model year
ones sitting dealers lots any lenghth time after new ones 
out things sell popular

because popular highpriced new high price used very
simple

i knew were overpriced when i bought i knew had terrible 
reliability record when i bought i didnt expect anything like i
got especially dealer network unable repair personal experience
has quickly cured me my infatuation machine
