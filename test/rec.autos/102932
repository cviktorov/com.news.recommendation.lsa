 few things keep mind about europe since you brought
 up my autobahn knowledge admittedly secondhand i believe
 following true

my knowledge about driving us also secondhand i think i can
correct your statements about our autobahn

 drivers much better disciplined europe than here

oh yeah would paradise fact you can forget from all ive
heard from my us relatives drivers esp here germany much more agg
ressive disciplined one my relatives la resident hired car
 nuernberg airport went about miles our home he said 
he grew about year older during ride swore hed never drive car 
germany again he kept his promise situation now 
even worse effect increased volume traffic
what you mean better disciplined should perhaps considered cautious due
 fear 
when driving around here you always have take consideration 
majority other drivers absolutely relies you expect nobody
fails sleeps many them exploit driving fast car can
go course only where allowed you might think dream 
so any mistake you make very high risk your health youre ex
posed situation from your very first day driver you learn 
handle you lose 
thats way i most people i know experience our traffic situation 
whether you think pleasant efficient up you i think we handle
 very high volume traffic high speeds modest compared 
 volume decreasing rates lethal accidents otoh more more
people esp women dislike driving because feel overtaxed threatened
 each accident one accident too much

 roads comprising autobahn much better designed than
 here usually include animal fences makes them
 far more predictable than most us highways

better designed maintained may animal fences very rare auto
bahnen many other streets have guardrails i hope thats right word 
 plank made from thick steel sheet fixed uprights its about feet high
those guardrails designed keeping vehicles road smaller animals
can crawl under plank bigger ones can easily jump over point 
 esp larger animals very rare germany tend also very
timid accidents caused animals neglegible danger

 all europe autobahn most places europe have
 speed limits arent outofline what we used have 
 us my friends werent lying me theyre typically 
 much higher than kmh

youre right speed linits even major part autobahn 
 attitude towards driving see above seems very similar 
 germany ive been france switzerland italy austria spain belgium
 netherlands besides you really cant rely residents abiding
 local speed limits ive got quite lot practise k miles im
used travel mph fyi car even smaller than rabbit i
consider driving highways round paris milano really thrill

i strongly suspect you wont find lot rabbit owners doing mph
nearly kmh autobahn i could wrong 

sorry youll find quite lot rabbitclasscar even smaller mine 
peugeot owners going fast small cars much hp very hip over
here most people buying cars arent afraid let them run

 some people
have respect own lives

i disagree size weight car rather irrelevant formula cars
weigh less than kg drivers have chance survive accidents 
 mph higher otoh when crashing against solid object mph
 makes difference whether you sit porsche mercedes tank 
 bicycle yourre dead
