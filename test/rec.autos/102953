thanx all those who responded particularly those never driven xxx
 heres what its like guys

ok we all know newage ats great traffic do satisfactory
job acceleration when you keep your foot buried carpet

my question regards downshifting downshifting pass ats 
good now manually moving lever point
where you would downshift manual eg approaching red light 
curve just tooling around parking lot st nd wo shifting
 why im still manualtrans bigot downshifting 
deceleration seems so natural when i try automatic 
tranny doesnt seem understand what i want

addendum isnt great after downshifting while approaching 
red light when light goes green youre already oncam
 turbos already spooled up zippppppppppp
