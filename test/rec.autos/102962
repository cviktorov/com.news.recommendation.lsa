can anyone offer any opinions ford probe ala how do 
 long run repair records reliability mileage etc

i am fixing buy car next few months aiming toward something
 little bigger than typical small car little more power i
am considering mx probe accord corolla sx 

 probe youngest bunch thus my interest opinions
 every magazine ratings book places excellent value
btw sx rearwheel drive due redesign 

thanks advance

while i dont read normally read group i looking valentine radar
information sigh maybe faq came across your posting

i bought probe gt pep last july now miles
after debating over sentra sernx mx mr stealth prelude 
 celica

check months consumer reports previous probe records 

my criteria fun car abs airbag over hp less than k
i thought about turbo checking insurance people ruled out
 tristar cars eclipsetalonetc were out since dont have air bag
ditto mustangalso abs
 sernxm fell pocketrocket category good used car buy
 mx almost rolled more than i liked 
i didnt like prelude dashinstrumentation all too weird me
 mr has much smaller nonpassenger space than i needed so out went
 celica ok underpowered when loaded options somewhat
overpriced too nonturbo form
i never considered sx since didnt have airbag i did look 
 its rwd virtues thats corolla never entered my mind
i should have looked mitsubishi vrdodge stealth more
since my list exhausted i bought probe 

 car design different than earlier years so its too early see its
reliability so far what its worth my comments

my dislikes
shutting door windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal
headlights have stuck up few times weather
air conditioning broke miles pressure cycling switch
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely
crammed engine little hope doityourselfers typical
parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts
underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways speedbumps typical
assembly gripes tape radiator screw fell out dash seat seams 
stitched properly hopefully just fluke
ford only gives key car cmon ford spend extra few pennies
rear hatch has padding corners when up im waiting day when
i bash my head corner
horn buttons behind air bag spokes center personal preference
tires fling dirtmud onto side car 

my likes
engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque definitely 
handling very good fwd understeer only limits
transmission speed must
usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere
very little torque steer full power much better than sho i drive
stability mph high gearing though
low cowl good visibility front
heated outside mirrors nice fog never tested freezing weather
absair bag see above
rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so trunk important
 shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still
tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping k 

 you can see im primarily interested engine while doesnt
have uummmph bigliter car turbo rush big selling
point me allaluminum value liter engine 

 overall car good buy money market segment hasnt changed
much since july prelude vtec honda del sol i drive from work
each day relatively smooth roads most noticable thing 
probes suspension doesnt like potholes when you test drive one find 
potholed road somewhere around town see jarring you get tolerable
 you have passengers all means bring them along too theyll find
 have room back youll find car rides
differently thats better up you also theres lot glass
around you which i wasnt expecting temperature inside car gets pretty
hot summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about
 lack ventilation you may want consider when combined 
 heat ive heard exhaust system has trouble mine works fine
leather keyless entry system werent available when i got car so
i cant comment them i got car before officially announced 
i prefer cloth leather anyway 

i wouldnt want car snow suspension too rough 
inevitable surprise potholes tires arent meant snow seats assume
 youre wearing lots thick clothing rain much better water 
generally beads off windshield freeway speed windshield wiper
controls easy understandable i barely hydroplaned once 
eagles i really trying 
 also definite lack cup holdersmall storage places gt
has map holders below speakers door theyre rigid plastic
 could fit two cassettes cds max center consolestorage binarm
rest has cup holder back front seats have cloth pouch
 thats change holders quite letdown from sho
 probe definitely peoplemover car econobox car

lastly dont store wet car covers back foam soak 
water up result smell pleasant
