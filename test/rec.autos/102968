 quality autobahns something myth road surface
isnt much different typical tx freeway better
 terms lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc

 light highways texas funny everywhere else ive been
 only light em junctions

i wont even get how much road markings vary between states 
localities except say some areas where markings 
essentially nonexistant

than most roads here dip asphalt you test your
shocks kill you dont get me wrong i love 

 would have quite severe i dont recall any us freeway
without road damage warnings i would regard unsafe
 any decent well damped car

i suspect you have very limited experience us freeways vary
dramatically particularly between states i can name number 
interstate highways various parts country where would 
very optimistic any car

im sure what you call quite severe terms road deviations
 i suspect every single bridge junction i through ct would 
considered so theyre hard take mph thats only
interstate ive seen deviations its one i drive
frequently

texas pretty much edgecase you cant assume everywhere
has roads good condition flat terrain 
wideopen spaces just aint so
