dear netters

i am looking buy used eagle talon tsi awd

i would concerned about how car driven how well 
maintained i own turbocharged one i would never buy 
turbocharged vehicle unless i knew owner hisher
drivingmaintenance habits

question tsi awd mentioned 
april consumer reports car avoid

i have been wondering about myself awd models 
s were identical except abs option 

 particular manual transmission

yes some owners had problems transaxles using
synthetic lubricants transaxles solved problem most
cases problem unique awds however 
common all models galant vr gsx had same transaxle
 i didnt see those listed cr

electrical system

i dont know any major complaints area except 
battery installed factory had low current rating 

 brakes were below par both models

 first fwd models those built before may were recalled 
brake upgrades some fwd awd owners had problems warped
rotors those us who insist using manual torque wrenches every
time lug nuts tightened have never had problem

 friend mine
ownes tsi awd he has had brake jobs pads

i can refer you someone who has gone through set pads one
day all depends how you drive seems most owners have
been getting between k set pads

one stuck valve

first time i hear about problem valve train cars
other than timing belt failures

 some clutchtransmission problem something
about stickinggrinding second gear doesnt seem
too bad one beats his car

 your friend beats car his unit 
representative sample cars reliability

my suggestion instead listening useless consumer reports
talk several owners mailing list may best way reach
 few them

i am willing suffer reliabilityfor speed looks seems
you have pay big buck you want all three anyway can
anyone please let me know how you like your talon any
problems you may have had repairs worth 

 humorimpaired skipto theend
 matter how much you pay you wont get all three examples

nsx reliability looks
ferrari reliability hhhhhh yeah right speed looks
