back f stuff second note auto tranny f
still shifts drivers command some preselected schedule 
driver still controls shifting transmission 

 now dispute production cars automatics 
 inherently more lossy than manuals theory my point all
 along whatever mechanical advantages manual has over 
 automatic can very easily lost driver who isnt skillful 

one thing gives automatic advantage launch fact 
 has torque converter vs clutch i know sounds strange 
 torque converter multiplies engine output when launching functions
 
 sort limited continuously variable transmission typically you get 
 torque multiplication times depending stall speed

i have yet see torque multiplier installed production automobile 
 systems do exist none presently installed production autos
 i am aware commonly called viscous drive cvts 
fluidic amplifiers 

contrasted clutch which merely slips when feathered result tq mult

what convertor does allow engine closer its
torque peak during launch before clutched car can fully engage its
driveline chevy proved many years ago camaro ets 
terminal mile times were close enough tpo identical speed 
auto cars note also major reason auto car can
get away fewer gears than manual slip convertor makes up
 fewer ratios before everyone starts yelling about proposed
 sspeed autos soon out note some manufacturers using 
speed manulas now 

once past lauch however converter begins coupling tq multiplication
effect reduced you should cam

correct
