my bbb autoline arbitration experience over 
 outcome decidedly mixed i won battle 
lost war arbitrator found car 
defective decided offer repurchase well below 
market value time hearing average 
retail my truck nada book 
 decision i wrote letter 
council better business bureaus pointing out 
fact you have automobile does 
depreciate rapidly manufacturer has incentive 
 deal you way 
manufacturer can loose because can turn around 
sell vehicle profit consumer awarded 
 repurchase attitude chevrolets 
representative hearing tends support 
point view he totally unprepared did 
seem take proceeding very seriously

i decided take repurchase even though i am 
getting totally screwed price i have 
 deal continuing repairs selling lemon 
myself i have case civil suit based 
 idaho lemon law i am planning send letter 
my elected representatives telling them how utterly 
ridiculous idaho lemon law law allows 
 use deduction equal irs mileage allowance 
 chevrolet were buying my gas paying 
 my insurance

summary case may i bought new ton
hd chevrolet pickup between may december 
 vehicle required repair after repair systems 
 required attention included transmission 
heater fan paint suspension motor main 
problem five speed manual transmission 
could install nondefective transmission 
least four attempts

so summary possible get repurchase 
you going get screwed price unless you 
paid too much first place your car 
happens model depreciates rapidly
