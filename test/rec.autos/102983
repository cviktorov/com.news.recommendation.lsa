 recautos since you people group may have best advice 
 experience troubled teenagers

 girl riding car seattle area when her mother who driving
 honked her horn car boys really upsetting
 makes my stomach turn would any parents doesnt your heart
 just go out poor mother


yes fred my heart prayers go out mother others who have 
been victims other senseless crimes

however i feel you have missed point previous postings see 
top your statement responsibility felt attack towards 
members group you attempting make members group
 required answer only people who should make statement people
who have experienced problem found workable solution

 teenagers both drive cars involved automotive vandalism 
 crime maybe someone newsgroup has had specific experience 
 dealing violent teenage offenders like kids same
 time maybe you would have some good advice those hostile people who
 sense now potential victims maybe you would have some good
 advice them how pay back andor make situation worse 
 maybe you have some good advice local authorities schools where
 problem prevalent again maybe youre interested 

many people interested have input i restate your last
sentence here seen attack members group people have

compelled sp respond

suggestion other group members matter
