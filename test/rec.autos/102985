i am currently car market would like opinions vw
passat glx how does compare toyota camry i thought car
looked very solid stable european only disappointment so far 
 doesnt offer airbao my next question why isnt vw
offering automobiles airbags should i pay extra three
thousand bmw even though smaller less powerful
than than passat

i think vw got caught out airbag thing its only been last
year two airbags have become significant selling feature
vw assumed automatic belts would satisfy govt requirements 
passive restraint didnt guess merican consumer would
actually make buy decisions based presence airbag

vw really hurting right now us market check out 
article last weeks autoweek about crisis vw golfs 
jettas coming from plant mexico dont have
 quality facility per normal vw practice us
launch jetta iii delayed again again until good chunk
 useful life design spent

i think passats come from germany so same
quality availability issue its nice car nice engine
whether vw player us market two years time 
different question

ill leave passat camry flamewar someone else
