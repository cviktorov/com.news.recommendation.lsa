 i wondering anyone can shed any light just how 
electronic odometers remember total elapsed mileage what kind 
memory stablereliable enough nonvolatile enough independent enough
 outside battery power last say years more life 
vehicle im amazed anything like could expected work 
 length time especially light all gizmos i work 
 doing good work months without breaking down somehow

mkt from thomsom has timekeeper clock bytes nvram which
has lithium battery backup battery has life years poweroff
operation installed car could left powered continuously 
draw much current battery would only used when your auto battery 
dead had been removed

side question how about legal ramifications selling used car 
 replaced odometer starts over miles after say k
actual miles looks like fraud would fairly easy price 
new odometer you can say has however many miles you want tell 
buyer has

 california have line transfer ownership form which states
 odometer mileage correct incorrect you required 
fill what you know guesstimate correct mileage you
lie form caught you can prosecuted buyer can
sue you value mileage differential
 
faster horses
younger women
older whiskey
more money
