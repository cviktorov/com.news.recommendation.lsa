 relates experience similar mine 
 comes part i wish i could have videotaped we go out
 front door sales manager shouts across entire showroom
 customers all go ahead you deserve buy nissan
 so my friend bought sentra
 

 kind behavior what i shocked my experience 
crying out loud how do turkeys think can talk customers 
 way still stay business again i dont expect sales people 
bow scrape grovel my presence i sure dont expect 
abused either i very surprised way sales people talked 
me other negotiating sessions i overheard neighboring sales 
cubicles evidently success rate high enough continue 
 do business way must lot people out who 
easy intimidate

 other hand im sure about one price haggling 
approach saturn other starting use i guess fixed 
price fair its ok maybe best approach do your homework 
before you go find out invoice prices car add reasonable 
profit dealer offer them price stick 
 get abusive just leave dont let them try screw you 
after deal agreed
