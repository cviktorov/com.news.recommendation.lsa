 my wife has informed me she wants convertible her next car

i about recommend you consider targa top over convertible 
drew made point very well when my wife i were our s we
did convertible thing triumphs now our mids we still
appreciate open air prefer targa types much less wind
noise objectspapers blowing around foreign objects getting 
car one still has almost all advantages convertible
