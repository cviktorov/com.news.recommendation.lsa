because i want get lowest price possible its called capitalism

i have news you capitalism practice maximizing
profits

same difference you lower your costs you increase your profits

personally im all bothered saturn pricing scheme i
dont want pay much theyre selling i can go buy 
different car from different dealer get nothing thats
competition you dealer can competitive charging what
 do making kind profit thats capitalism its best
 more power em


id rather have consumer dictate what things cost 
dealers

sorry neither dictates cost its negotiation
whether its up front honda dealership all out 
dickering war more removed larger economic scale
ie saturn cant sell its price price drops
 company stops building them remains negotiated
value controlled market forces think consumer 
controls price ludicrous consumer controled
price cars would freeand one would build 
cars
