 kind behavior what i shocked my experience 
 crying out loud how do turkeys think can talk customers 
 way still stay business again i dont expect sales people 
 bow scrape grovel my presence i sure dont expect 
 abused either i very surprised way sales people talked 
 me other negotiating sessions i overheard neighboring sales 
 cubicles evidently success rate high enough continue 
 do business way must lot people out who 
 easy intimidate
 

 couple months ago i went dealership test drive car afterwards
we sat down discuss prices i explained i wanted car just like 
one i drove different color he said he could get one exactly like
i wanted from dealer network within day we negotiated price 
signed deal

next day i get call he explains goofed had neglected
 take account price increase last price increase had occurred
over months prior my visit i still wanted car i would
have fork over another alternative would honor 
price i bought car i test drove which had been sitting around 
 months had few miles i said goodbye good
example how can lowball you still cover butts its too
bad more people dont demand honesty types dealers would
 longer business 

 next dealership i went straightforward honest first thing 
salesman said letss see what you have dealer cost work out
how much profit i should make deal went through problems
