why should good driver terrified mph only thing i fear
going drivers who switch left lane without using
either rearviewmirror flashers doing aint rush
 me its fun i get where i want go much faster

 defense drivers who right lane here states people simply do expect when driving overtaken speed differential mph i dont think because stupid course exceptions just programmed because mph limit do you states when you look rearview always calculate future positions cars based speed differential 
dont get me wrong i love drive left lane fast when i overtake
cars who right i slow down tad bit i were rely judgement other car recognize speed differential i would stupid one 

just satiate my curiosity why would make you stupid one seems
 me everybody should aware enough what going you do need
 calculate future position you need look your mirrors little
more you glance around you able tell how much faster than you
 car going maybe precisely well enough know you should
let him around before you try pass i know what you talking about
about other driver being startled because i myself have been startled
 drivers cruising around mph when im doin problem
though i saw fault barreling around me my fault
 paying attention my taskathand i should have been
oddly enough since nd timehappened x around mo when id had my
liscence around mo i havent been startledand ive been passed 
cars doing roughly twice speed my car another odd occurance 
fact only seems happen long tripsand i drive along 
them doesnt happen all even long trips adrenaline
 do youive had bad cop experiences speeding so anything
over limit adrenalizing mescared ill get caught maybe
 should raise limit so we can pay better attention

just curious my otwo
