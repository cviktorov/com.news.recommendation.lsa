why anyone would order sho automatic transmission 
beyond me you cant handle stick you should stick 
regular taurus leave sho real drivers 
say arent real drivers who cant use stick eg
disabled persons arent any position use 
sho anyway 

i would willing bet we removed automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like l
mustangs camaros like wed cut down number 
accidents each year autos fine sedate little sedans
 have business performance cars imho

i have disagree i have z speed auto
w overdrive really better way chevy autos reknowned
 long life ability handle copious amount power i live 
 dallas area manual would much harder drive traffic 
here now i still lived out sticks like i used manual would 
more fun 

safetywise auto less distractingi would hate have 
shifting gears while i trying ease traffic freeways here
performancewise i can hold my own against any stock mustang 
camaro w five speed 

all imho
