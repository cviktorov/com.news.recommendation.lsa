how about thousands kind teenagers who volunteer local
agencies help children seniors homeless

hear hear thanks robbie

you also dont read much about violence against teenagers 
george bush burying alive tens thousands unarmed iraqi yearolds
who were trying surrender bulldozers


 other hand i think true without singling out teenagers
 blame violence more socially acceptable than used 
those us whod like discourage violence have plenty work do
 people all ages

well isnt right group i have say i dont
think violence any more socially acceptable now any means how
can you say when we used have pistoltoting gunslingers 
heros even gangland thugs being considered romantic do you think
our great grandparent got yelled parents playing cowboys
 indians i dont think so behavior somewhat encouraged
back fact
i think only difference between now nowadays when
some teenager kills another one classroom california we here 
about ma same day back old days theyd never hear 
about something like period 

sorry about posting recautos where came up
