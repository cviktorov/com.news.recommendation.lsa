 after agreeing terms i signed contract drove home my new
 car later same night i noticed terms were
 different from terms i had agreed i made stupid mistake
 checking everything contract all happened last
 saturday
 
 i have heard coolingoff law allowing me three days
 reconsider contract true can anyone point me 
 law transaction happened dealership matters
 
 cooling off period applies only certain situations lik ewhen
 you solicited home i also think cooling off period ends
 you actually accept merchandise
 
 were case any car buyer would have right return
 slightly used highly devalued car days after buying yeah 
 thats trick i want buy new car id have firend buy 
 return one go negotiate better deal preowned
 used car

however you agree some terms when about sign 
dealer slips you contract different terms leads you 
believe embodies terms you verbally agreed 
 fraud day limit restitution fraud

you may have sue win get out you almost
certainly have threaten sue
