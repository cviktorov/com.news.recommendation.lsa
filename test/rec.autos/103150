 my wife has informed me she wants convertible her next car

i about recommend you consider targa top over convertible 
drew made point very well when my wife i were our s we
did convertible thing triumphs now our mids we still
appreciate open air prefer targa types much less wind
noise objectspapers blowing around foreign objects getting 
car one still has almost all advantages convertible 


my last car had ttops big ttops my current car convertible
imho youre after convertible feel ttops opentop
sunroofs moonroofs whatever just dont cut theres 
substitute convertible youre after sun beating
down you wind your hair teeth flopsum 
jetsum getting car noises associated 
whooshing wind youre after convertible feel
so go something least hole above driver dont call
 convertible

 i do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll
bar rollover situation course id rather test 
 my car i too am my early s

 convertibleaccept substitute
