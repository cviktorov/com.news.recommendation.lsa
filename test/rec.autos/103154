well depends what kind locking lugnuts you have my previous
car had locking lugnuts weighed about oz more than others 
 locking lugnuts were factory equipment according factory
service manual after tire balancing technicianmechanic 
supposed put oz counterweight rim opposite locking
nut i always had vibration problems those stupid lugnuts since 
one ever did service correctly i eventually got rid locking
lugnuts replaced them standard lugnuts unfortunately i
found out about counterweighting technique months after i got rid
 locking nuts 

my present car saturn sc has locking lugnuts i bought 
dealer made specifically saturn have been made 
 exactly same weight nonlocking lugnuts said so 
package i verified myself i havent had any vibration problems
 tires all due nuts ownership i did
have some other vibration problems due poor job tire
balancing
