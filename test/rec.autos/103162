after agreeing terms i signed contract drove home my new
car later same night i noticed terms were
different from terms i had agreed i made stupid mistake
 checking everything contract all happened last
saturday

i have heard coolingoff law allowing me three days
 reconsider contract true can anyone point me 
law transaction happened dealership matters

 cooling off period applies only certain situations lik ewhen
you solicited home i also think cooling off period ends
 you actually accept merchandise

 were case any car buyer would have right return
 slightly used highly devalued car days after buying yeah 
thats trick i want buy new car id have firend buy 
 return one go negotiate better deal preowned
used car

 discussion purposes only

 other hand can proven its possible changed 
terms could thrown out question whether 
agreement contains merger clause see ucc parol 
evidence were talking about warranties course 
ucc should looked 

 we have so little information none us can say anything 
conclusive
