im familiar trannies used winston cup transam
 cars ive played transmissions were racing variety 
 dog clutches instead sychros transmission dog clutches 
 gears always engaged each other moving dog clutches
 engages gears shafts motorcycle transmissions same way
 shifting without clutch transmission syncros can cause
 transmission damage only question being how long takesto grenade
 something trans my pulsar se about k miles 
 had weak tranny first place
 
 just out curiosity how dog clutch any different from synchro
 transmission what you described sounds same me fact what little
 ive studied trannies instructor referred synchros dogs
 said were synonymous gears always meshed synchronized
 gearbox you slip synchro gears back forth shifting least
 what i taught explain por favour

motorcycle transmissions dont have synchros engagment dogs very
corse sloppy maybe teeth dogs side 
gears engage next gear over forks slide gears back
 forth shift start apply pressure same time 
clutch pulled clutch hand lever shift quickly 
you try slow lazy shift grind you just have pop 
 next gear before has chance grind isnt neutral
between gears obviously you cant select 
shifter so double clutching possibility speed shifting
which what i have always heard clutchless shifting called works
pretty well upshifts some practice i usually use 
clutchespecially lower gears

i think auto automobile trannys similar except 
engagment dogs very fine slop addition 
syncho rings gear teeth always engaged auto transmissions
 synchronized may nonsynchro gears reverse
 sometimes first
