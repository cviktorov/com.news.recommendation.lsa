dont get me wrong i love drive left lane fast when i overtake
cars who right i slow down tad bit i were rely judgement other car recognize speed differential i would stupid one 

just satiate my curiosity why would make you stupid one seems
 me everybody should aware enough what going you do need

i couldnt agree more how should work people should also always see motorcycles too

i constantly scan behind me i have one those wink mirrors two outside mirrors i actually spend just much time checking my six cops you know

i still get caught off guard every now 


maybe i didnt word right first time what i trying say you plan blow somebody very high speed differential you assume you safe because guy sees you you stupid course depends circumstances i have had some very scary instances when i assumed i dont think all fault other guy now he going thats whole different story

ok i can agree because we have both proved what ideally
supposed happen isnt always even though im rearely one doing
 passing i dont see where makes you stupid i agree you 
think you safe because other guy supposed have been paying 
attention yes you just dumb othermaybe dumber
