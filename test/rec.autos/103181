 i find method much better myself too although i do really
 hate when bolt finally comes loose wrench my
 hand both come crashing my face after coming which 
 about minutes later i change my clothes because time
 all oil has drained me ice my entire face suck
 down about tylenol ease pain later day i 
 proceed refilling engine oil
 
 its just crazy how i try change oil my cars one
 weekendi go through about bottles tylenol bags ice

oh thats so bad every time i try change oil i forget 
shut off engine first hot oil comes out scalds me blinds
me engine starts overheat while im screaming agony
 trying crawl out from under car i grab red hot exhaust
pipe get third degree burns my hands my screams intensify i
finally emerge from under car i struggle my feet front 
 car whereupon radiator hose ruptures sprays me super
heated coolant engine seizes before cylinder head
explodes piercing my flesh fragments red hot iron

 happens every time im starting think i should pay mechanic
 instead paying hospital dealer new
car gets costly when you change oil every miles
