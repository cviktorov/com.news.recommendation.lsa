im market new car currently i own mazda mx dx
which has served me just fine however id like get
 door car since i dont relish thought moving carseat
around door car my criteria door ac amfm cassette
quick acceleration cruise control decent rear seat legroom my
husband footer must also under k
preferably closer k range which probably rule out
 accord cars have caught my eye toyota corolla 
toyata camry mazda pontiac grand am pontiac grand prix 
honda accord civic its roomy enough still comes 
door model hyundai sonata maybe even small oldsmobile 
although achieva all opinions benchmarks
recommendations etc welcome

 civic does still come door model my wife i looked
quite seriously prizm corolla civic well 
some other cars our impressions all three seemed well built had
 features we wanted similar features you want
except cruise control we want manual transmission 
considering antilock brakes i also hate automatic seatbelts we
both think having airbag plus general comfort 
performance were both significant

some specific s s listed below

mazda 
 very comfortable roomy
 can theoretically get abs dx model though practice 
 hard find
 base price base model includes numerous little things like
 tach variable speed wipers rear defroster split folding rear seat
 more expensive than many other cars listed below

honda civic
 dx gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here
 comfortable front seat
 adjustable seat belt mounting
 abs without ex model includes s other things like sunroof

geo prizmtoyota corolla
 seats very comfortable us your mileage may vary
 adjustable seat belt mounting
 can get abs without lots other extras

saturn
 sl quite comfortable though sl less so
 motorized attack belts

dodge spirit
 real outstanding s seemed generally ok
 rear seat does fold down

chevy corsica
 comes abs standard
 lower would you buy car again safety ratings 
 consumer reports than first cars above
 suspension didnt feel stiff others would 
 some

 honda accord toyota camry were both more expensive than 
 our minds significantly better

we probably gave disproportionately low consideration big 
due my wifes familys general dislike chrysler products
b some unimpressive gm products owned my parents housemate
 mine c taurus comes automatic transmission i find 
seat tempo very uncomfortable escort has attack belts
 air bag

well probably end up i saw dx ac 
cassette advertised just under washington post april 
i think my local dealer says can match price i 
probably get maybe tomorrow main question my mind
 whether i have do factory order preference
order get one abs whether dealership 
run price up lot i do so
