based my experience fj hardtop jeepstyle model i 
would definitely give new model consideration i were market 
older models very well built unless toyota lost its mind i would
assume until proven otherwise newer models have inherited some
 all qualities ancestors

two major differences running gear im aware need study
my has solid front axle housing whereas newer models have
independant front suspension solid axle theoretically stronger 
more reliable than newer model only experience tell 
independant front suspension doubt compromise made satisfy
 typical user who never need real utility vehicle second
difference type transfer case used newer models im
 sure i think tioyota went fulltime wd allwheel drive
system older landcruisers have lockup type both have 
advantages disadvantages
