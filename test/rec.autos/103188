i figure mph collisions brick walls arent common enough
 me spend much extra money protection 
lots lowspeed collisions do worry me

get mph accident you may reconsider ive been one
 really scarey my life something i value more
than cars looks handeling consider insurance may 
happen often when does youll sure glad you got safe car

granted tests arent perfect id much rather car 
did well test than car did horribly 

you raise valid point again its tradeoff how much money
do you want spend kind protection you could buy 
volvo saab benz get really good crash protection other
luxuries youll pay significantly more my case its
out question because all those cars beyond my budget

even highspeed headon collisions most beneficial item you can
have good old point seatbelt nowadays least us
you get airbag you get point belt so presumably you get 
added safety benefit well thats something i certainly look
 which can had inexpensive cars

my course
