 why turn question around why automatics so common 
 us

because some people like them some people actually need them

my guess when tried couple manuals torquerich
vs sixties clutches turned out real killers you had 
use both feet depress has just lived 

yeah right real muscle cars had manual transmission 
clutches arent heavy shelbyamerican used plenty 
highpowered hightorque engines carroll only put autos 
his cars because people wanted them blasphemers heretics
burn them burn them defiling shelby auto 
real cobras were ultimate sports car 
time had bigblock fords which turned out prodigious amounts
 power torque none them had automatics 

 also automatic v engine can real fun drive

yeah you call gear shift middle curve fun 

i personally would love have galaxie liter coupe
 firebreathing fouronnafloor go along side
my galaxie pillarless hardtop firebreathing 
 threeonnatree i love sound dual exhaust 
morning theres comparison between real american
muscle car car big engine automatic imho
