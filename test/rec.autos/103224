 some comments
 
 good performance mid high speeds can obtained adjusting 
 top gear final drive ratios contrary popular misperception 
 number japanese cars have quite good performance from top
 gear 

 problem question do perform consistently all
conditions roads winds curves speed do so hours end 
year after year without giving driver white knuckles from my experience 
 autobahnsautostrade good touring car can easily distinguished its 
poise mph best stay cruise control hours ive
seen typical boy racer fiat try keep up sure hit century
mark wind blows wrong way change lanes 
overpass may fly right guardrail buffeting can 
severe enough make hood bend tires can melt pothole can
kill many german cars designed environment even cant
seem get out own way from stop light mercedes come mind 
particular another design point fuel economy those speeds 
germans gear car very good high speed efficiency typical mb e turns
 almost stall 

good point i have idea how either my hondas handle mph
nor do reach however using high mph

 quite amenable long high speed drives ive done several
k mile trips my civic problems whatsoever last big trip
i made driving from new york texas i remember driving 
miles day typically mph without any problems im sure i 
would have been more comfortable driving benz white knuckles
 problems winds curves 

 trip back from new orleans after mardi gras where
we were doing all way houston problems

b both my cars have surprising good fuel economy high speeds i see
 difference between sustained mph sustained mph trip
back from new orleans we got about mpg my integra quite ok mind
you engine revs almost k civic markedly better
than integra fuel economy k miles down road i still
get mpg mph driving


 b i cant understand why highscale european marquees afraid
 design engines can repeatedly revved near redline 
 low gears i have been doing last k miles 
 my lowly civic detriment either engine clutch
 getting excellent mpg boot id call engineering hack
 cover up design deficiencies

 k miles youd still breakingin highscale european marquee 
typically designed last miles per engine mi per
chassis record now over miles benz diesel ive
read about transmissions lasting miles speaking 

now now you cant compare diesel gasoline engine i see enough
bmws gasoline mercs sale have k miles them advertise 
rebuilt engines honda build accord k id darn well
expect sucker last k miles

diesels have very good efficiency cost acceleration very
popular all european cars diesel considered green fuel from 
smallest econoboxes luxobarges again we see difference mentality
diesels us considered slightly worse than useless extremely
dirty boot so you cant give them away

ever got caught behind early s sdl stop light its 
pleasant newer mbs lot better though diesel volvos
 vws probably smelliest offenders

 economy why should we care gas cheap i personally wouldnt
buy diesel car any reason what does buy me
