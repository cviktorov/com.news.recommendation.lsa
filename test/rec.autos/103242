hello

 does anyone know how take out bolt under engine
compartment should i turn clockwise counter i tried any kind
 lubricants wdetc i still failed
 do you think i can use electric drill change suitable
bit turn out i can succeed can i retighten too
tight safe without oil leak

you shouldnt need any power tools undo electric drill
probably wont give you much extra torque anyway wd help
things seized due rust unlikely drain
plug you should able undo spanner when 
loosens probably become very loose you bash your
knuckles underside car price you must
pay doing you own work

 thats price you pay knowing how use 
wrench you want pull wrench towards you away from
painful knuckle splitting hard things you cant pull 
because things way push open hand

i find method much better myself too although i do really
hate when bolt finally comes loose wrench my
hand both come crashing my face after coming which 
about minutes later i change my clothes because time
all oil has drained me ice my entire face suck
down about tylenol ease pain later day i 
proceed refilling engine oil

its just crazy how i try change oil my cars one
weekendi go through about bottles tylenol bags ice
