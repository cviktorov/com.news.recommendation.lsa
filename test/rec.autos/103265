 water gradually builds up trunk my friends ford probe every
 once while we would have remove spare scoop out water
 under plywoodcarpet cover trunk i would guess usually 
happens
 after good thunder storm few qs
 
 common problem
 where drain holes located hatch

i noticed my probe also when recently cleaning out back i 
think water coming up through some rubber stoppered holes beneath 
spare mine looked slightly worn water water damage above 
 level spare area 

 has taken low priority since i just found out while rotating my tires 
 i have torn cv boot ugh

ive got gt has smoked taillight assembly i think where
 water getting when i first got had month one rear
taillights fogged up moisture i took dealer replaced
 entire assembly happened other one about months later time
i happened look spare tire well noticed water standing 
dealer more reluctant time replace i convinced them 
fix must have had deal number other probes same
problem i havent noticed water taillamps trunk last 
years just last month taillamp just fogged up again im going try
 take back get them fix again im real tempted drill some vent
 drain holes tops bottoms assembly forget about 
getting very annoying almost every other gt ive seen has had problem
