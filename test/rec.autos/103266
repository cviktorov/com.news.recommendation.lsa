i figure mph collisions brick walls arent common enough
 me spend much extra money protection 
lots lowspeed collisions do worry me

get mph accident you may reconsider ive been one
 really scarey my life something i value more
than cars looks handeling consider insurance may 
happen often when does youll sure glad you got safe car

granted tests arent perfect id much rather car 
did well test than car did horribly 

you raise valid point again its tradeoff how much money
do you want spend kind protection you could buy 
volvo saab benz get really good crash protection other
luxuries youll pay significantly more my case its
out question because all those cars beyond my budget

ive been two major auto accidents both were multiple car worst
 headon three car collision t intersection one person ran stop
sign both cases i stopped had place go i saw 
coming both times 

even highspeed headon collisions most beneficial item you can
have good old point seatbelt nowadays least us
you get airbag you get point belt so presumably you get 
added safety benefit well thats something i certainly look
 which can had inexpensive cars

 you really want add safety any car simply add cage 
car available cheap about usa add 
four five six point belts you walk away from collisions 
were otherwise survivable instead people spending little
extra money we get legislation says govt must mandate minimal
level protection everyone 

one other significant factor improving ones own safety get some
training improve your safety more than any other single
investment driveride defensively does mean you have
 doddering old stick mud people here tend enthuse about
autos more than average probably top th percentile driving
ability still we sometimes overlook obvious ive been two
driving schools three riding schools my motorcycle very
worthwhile investment besides lot fun too 

safety what you make just because carmaker doesnt provide you
 adequate level protection doesnt mean you have leave go
