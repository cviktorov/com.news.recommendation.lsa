i have disagree i have z speed auto
w overdrive really better way chevy autos reknowned
 long life ability handle copious amount power i live 
 dallas area manual would much harder drive traffic 
here now i still lived out sticks like i used manual would 
more fun 

i dont know its much issue ablility handle 
power power lose torque converter etc

safetywise auto less distractingi would hate have 
shifting gears while i trying ease traffic freeways here
performancewise i can hold my own against any stock mustang 
camaro w five speed 

however you encounter formula l speed manual
youll sol im afraid btw i know what i speak former
