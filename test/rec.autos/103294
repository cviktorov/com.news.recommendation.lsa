remember roads america designed speeds above meaning 
would safe roads like autobahn smoother straiter
wider slightly banked 

example few months back i traveling late night am so
 i changing highways bent crosssing curved off south
east becoming hidden trees after about ft continued 
left strait north i wanted turn north checked south lane rolled
 crossing checked north lane nevertheless wasnt 
 car sight so i took one last look pulled left hand lane
now my car isnt sec performer i corect lane 
over decent time even i wasnt wasting time 
 i checked my mirror saw mustang closing my lane fast he 
had just turned corner just noticing me luckly he saw me 
changed lanes time i estamate he moving excess so
i just stander i had chance runing from him moving out 
 his way im glad he saw my brake lights time i shudder 
think what would have happened had i wainted pull out 
left time he needed dodge me

rule just because your car can do your way clear
dont assume stay way
