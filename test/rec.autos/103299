i just have got remind all you yes
thats right somtime fall ford granddaddy cars
 introducing allnew megacool
waytoofastforaccorddrivers mustang its supposed 
 streamlined looking similar mach iii concept car
ford came out around january i cant wait anyone out
 hear anything about recently

 everything ive read correct ford doing nothing re
skinning existing mustang minor suspension modifications
 pictures ive seen indicate didnt do very good job
 
 new mustang nothing recycle year old car

gee already
yes still fox program chasis anything differe
nt new car far mechanicals unknown suspension most
likely changed well drive drain from what has been printed 
 clear idea what done some say have
 modular v others current small block just have wait see
also far styling goes from what i seen good return tradition
c scoop sides roof line much like fastback

you know im ford fan i must say so im looking forward next
mustang i have faith fine product more desireable
than camaro now you know thats mho 

 differences days between ford gm so much quality
just philosophy used quality philosophy gm 
barely catching up have more room improvement 
can only made up time stss still come off assembly line
 screwed up paint stripes poor trunkdoorhoodpanel alignments
its those year old plants latest gm products still come
 standard equipment rattledash tm like i said theyre
getting better making move right direction

 beat ford market camarofirebird really only
 words production vehicles limited until 
end year keeping selling prices above msrp most part
since so many twitching camaro fans out i wouldnt
press ford hurry mustang since final wait could worth 
besides bowtie fanatic gonna buy mustang anyway

i do put much stock mag rags inside information even
ford rep quotes taurus pretty much surprise when 
finally disclosed its entirety inside information had 
taurus v rearwheel drive one point i wouldnt look
 simple repaneled mustang folks you may cheating yourself
 you do theres lot potential ford hasnt released new
car without wheel years mustang project has been
brewing least right wheel could happen those
modular vs out too interest cafe 
competition dont rule those out either your ignorant you do
 so many spy shots artist renderings out 
who really knows what itll look like mach iii doubt 
highly

 next mustang fords highest profile car attracts
way more attention than camarofirebird because its heritage
 more embedded general public dont lie yourself 
believe ford forfeit 

i submit mustang success enough elicit
defensive remarks from some heavy camaro fans here you know
intelligent critical spews like mustang bites man some 
you already beginning i predict mustang camaro
 comparable performers usual i predict 
differences subjective areas like looks feel usual
 camaro still huge automobile mustang retain its
cabrearward styling short ponycar wheelbase camaro still
reaches out fighter pilot while mustang appeal 
 driver camaro still sell muscle car set while
 mustang continue sell collegedegreed muscle car set
both more refined i do think camaro 
 clear winner

unless ford gets v hp romeo you dont seriously believe
 designed mark viii only do you
