 any mr owners motorhead gurus out know why
my mrs engine sounds noisy mrs engine noisy best times 
 even nice nose its one those very ugly noises 

assuming yours non turbo mr gruffness characteristic 
 large inline doesnt have balance shafts i guess toyota
didnt care about little details like when can brag about
 mid engine configuration flashy styling

myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration 
recommendation which has inline larger than liters 
balance shafts good rule thumb keep mind you
ever want halfway decent engine 

 noise really bugs you nothing else you can do
except sell get v

mrs original guy did indicate year his mr its 
first generation car like my has liter engine perhaps
same engine supercharger its 
 sound he describes common any older toyota engine i ever heard
i dont know relevance his observations about oil changes my simply
makes noise all annoying mind you you hear well when 
engine right behind your left ear
