im considering switching geico insurance have heard 
 do assign specific agent each policy claim i 
worried might real pain when you make claim i have
also heard try get rid you you have accident

ive read group geico has funded purchasing radar
guns police depts im sure where


geico has purchased radar guns several states i know have done
 here ct

i have also heard horror stories about people have been insured geico
 years had accident were immediately dropped once
youve been dropped any insruance company you become labled high
risk end up forking out times what you should insurance

 must vary from state state because our old company kemper wanted
 drop me keeping my wife tripple our premium because i had ticket
only points mph over speed limit well i called geico 
insured both my wife i less we were previously paying
kemper

generally i hate whole insurance game i realize necessary
 way person can get dicked around doesnt make any sense

one good thing about geico everything can handled over
 phone



my suggestion stay where you shop around stay away from geico
