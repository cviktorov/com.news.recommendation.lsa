my suggestion stay where you shop around stay away from geico

i strongly agree jeff heres my horror story many years back
i switched geico from state farm save some i have relatively
new sports car which we covered liability collision 
comprehensive make car new models came out january
 september like other makes car purchased august 
 year

we also had much older clunker which we only wanted liability 
low behold vandal slashed roof sports car we put 
 claim october still current model year 
 car new top installation we had deductible
so we should have gotten you had go geicos local office
 have adjuster see car unlike state farm sent adjusters
 shop your place he said since car now one year
old well depreciate top so youll get claim
 also count accident against you so your rate may increase

 hassle continued we got letter from geico saying claim
denied your policy car doesnt cover i learned
 records had full coverage collision etc our old
clunker only had liability new car mixed up
our cars records i fixed top myself some carpet
thread dropped my claim still charged me accident
i cancelled my policy switched another company

 coup de gras came when sent me bill additional balance
due difference collisioncomprehensive cost between my sports
car my clunker i returned bill unpaid nastygram
plus explicity directions perform rectocranial insertion
havent heard from them since

 everyones entitled my opinion
