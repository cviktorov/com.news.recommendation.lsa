 sound he describes common any older toyota engine i ever heard
i dont know relevance his observations about oil changes my simply
makes noise all annoying mind you you hear well when 
engine right behind your left ear 

i think those mrs would describe engine sweet 
little loud those mrs i cant imagine any unbiased person
paying any compliments sounded like my exdormmates rusty chevy
chevette i would want redline just music
 i would short shift so would shut up new
camry features balance shafts i guess since mr getting
 axe too late them do anything about 

 mystery turbo mr only liters engineers
had enough integrity prevent any further abuses also europe
 mr mk nonturbo also only liters usual 
undiscriminating american market japanese must good
gets dogs fair we also got turbo which europeans

well music my ears i often turn my stereo off just run
 towards red line nice twisty roads toyota engines idle have
 strange bells whisstles bottom matal can sound i cant
describe any better
