 earlier i commented valentine jimfcenterlinecom replied
 about value units bogey counter i didnt really go 
 why i called feature gimmick so here more explanation thanks
 jim good comments opinion
 
 
 

 from what i understand valentine can only tell 
 microwaves coming from front rear both only
 two antennas coming from both interpreted 
 side bogey bogey counts determined sources 
 relative strength one another even reflections 
 same source
 
 
 

 sounds like your analysis based hypothesis 
actually using valentine id like give some feedback based 
real life experince i keep valentine advanced logic mode
 rarely lights up christmas tree only time does
 when i am middle major shopping area makes
sense does since sources coming from many different
directions i have found valentine consistent its
reporting bogeys regardless any moving cars area

i have found directional indication very useful one case
 two radar traps set up within one mile each other i
passed first radar trap direction indication changed 
 detector set off again pointing forward direction 
other radar detectors i would have assumed due reflection
 valentine i knew high probability 
 another trap 

 other occasions directional helped discern false alarm from
 true alarm example i pass source direction indicator
changes directional also allows me focus my attention where
 signal might coming from instead having look all over 
place when car approaching me from rear detector
 leaks i can tell signal coming from rear 
car passes me i can verify source other detectors i would
have been unable do would have had assume radar
trap when none

ive had valentine several months now find its added features
 useful gimmicks
