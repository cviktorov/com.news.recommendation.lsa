 i heard diesels considered cleanerburning than
 gas engines because emit less carbon monoxide
 hydrocarbons oxides nitrogen co hc nox
 
 can put out lot particulate matter i heard
 something about legislation being discussed clean up
 diesel emissions anything works 
 install scrubbers diesels how about feasibility
 installing them trucks cars would any
 different than catylitic converter id assume easier
 since were removing particulate matter instead converting
 gasses lets hear peoples opinions

 really bugs me emissions diesels cleanest any vechicle
 considered so polluting banned passenger cars
 california what bunch crap diesel fuel choice 
enviromental benefit europe while here its illegal same reason

 particulates nothing carbon just annoyance worst
nothing beats diesel cycle efficiency emissions torque engine
durability its also cheaper

just clear things up why i posted question way
i debating coworker about diesels i claimed were
cleanerburning than gas engines he said extra junk put out them
 offset savings greenhouse gasses i made all same claims
you did one question his what about carbon i said 
 harmless he wanted know how get rid i suggested
scrubbers i figured would harder more expensive install
than cats does exist any designs scrubber id like
 know just answer his final question i convinced him diesels
 cleaner otherwise

btw i named my subject dirty diesels because i knew would get reaction
out people who knew were cleaner than gas engines theyd
