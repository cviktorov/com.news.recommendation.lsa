 stay away from geico

 recent car driver issue has article about geico giving free
 laser guns police departments increase theyre speed limit
 enforcement article also said you get speeding ticket
 your premium increase dramatically based how much over 
 limit you were i remember correctly more than over
 youll get something like increase

 claims had accident filed claim he dropped 
 immediately since he has been state farm years
