 about changing oil every miles thats ok newer audis 
 only require after every miles i am talking about oil change
 just query do you drive your car very very carefully like sudden 
 acceleration etc yeah m oil change seems quite reasonable
 you drive kinda fast id get bit up tight abot thingy
 
 point note just because first light came k doesnt mean

hmm service indicators i have works way
 green yellow red indicators
 initially all green indicators few minutes when you start
 your car computer actually sense how you drive your car 
 time goes green indicators start go off one one 
 yellow indicator turn red indicator go
 you should get service when time green indicators off
 
 after service mechanicor you reset service indicators 
 computer starts counting again

so i expect have toolor procedure reset so green lights 
come yellow red lights go off

i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how reset 
indicator

its first european car i have changing oil miles 
surprise me its big plus i wonder how could happen
since oil lose its lubrication ability over time i thought its oil 
 vehicle determines how often we should change oil

any bmw owner net response welcomed

ps my initial question how do you seset service indicator bmw
