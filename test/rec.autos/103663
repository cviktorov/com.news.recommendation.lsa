 i heard diesels considered cleanerburning than
 gas engines because emit less carbon monoxide
 hydrocarbons oxides nitrogen co hc nox
 
 can put out lot particulate matter i heard
 something about legislation being discussed clean up
 diesel emissions anything works 
 install scrubbers diesels how about feasibility
 installing them trucks cars would any
 different than catylitic converter id assume easier
 since were removing particulate matter instead converting
 gasses lets hear peoples opinions
 
 
vw mercedes have tinkered particulate traps also vw
uses kind turbocharger jetta ecodiesel helps
reduce particulates well although i dont know 
mechanics 
 
many diesel carsbusses trucks europe now being
equipped catalysts traps effort clean up
diesel emissions already well below legal limits anyway
 
its shame gm had soil diesels reputation 
passenger cars prevent further resource devotion 
research making outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead gas engines emissions

 i sure dont know what how measure regards diesel 
 motors cars trucks busses i think probably
 measuring wrong pollutants wrong time both

 i certainly find offensive drive behind diesel bus 
 diesel truck some diesel cars stink its always
 rollupthewindows panic time when one comes ducks front
 me when i am driving my family

 i dont think combustion mixture kept under very good
 control diesel engines thats why stink so 
 invisible unsmellable pollutants reduced diesels yeah
 well so what someone forgot about visible stinky kind 
 far i am concerned those kind just bad

 i am all destinking diesel vehicles itll keep 
 traffic signs cleaner too
