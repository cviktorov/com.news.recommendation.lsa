 hmm service indicators i have works way
 green yellow red indicators
 initially all green indicators few minutes when you start
 your car computer actually sense how you drive your car 
 time goes green indicators start go off one one 
 yellow indicator turn red indicator go
 you should get service when time green indicators off
 
 after service mechanicor you reset service indicators 
 computer starts counting again
 
 so i expect have toolor procedure reset so green lights 
 come yellow red lights go off
 
 i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how reset 
 indicator
 
 its first european car i have changing oil miles 
 surprise me its big plus i wonder how could happen
 since oil lose its lubrication ability over time i thought its oil 
 vehicle determines how often we should change oil
 
 any bmw owner net response welcomed
 
 ps my initial question how do you seset service indicator bmw
 
 derek 

 perfectly legal tool available reset bimmer service lights
 cost you from mailorder buying one far outweighs
 possible consequences destroying all electronics you try
di yourself 
you wonder how people do oil change without knowing how reset
why reseting so important only reason doing
 stop annoyance red light staring you 
forget european cars you only need change oil every
 crap anyone serious about keeping engine good shape 
extending its life change every inc filter dont wait
 servive lights come before servicing car 
i bought bmw about months ago had green lights i have changed
 oil every completly flushed brake fliud changed all filtersoil
air fuel changed transmission drive oils
 done almost all other things req service 
 service after nearly miles i am still green lights
after winter burlington snowing today bad

good luck
