 hello auto enthusiasts

 viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor 
 supposedly detects people approcahing car
 

 primarily convertibles i have convertible have looked 
 feature detail alpine actually makes better radar unit you want
 get one has zones can shut down independently so
 one side your car has pedestrian traffic something else 
would trigger alarm shuts down zone rather pulls tighter
i dont see real benefit unless you have convertible you
leave top down 

avoid voice alarm can added radar package talks 
people walk i saw one installed lotus esprit kids would
taunt seeing how close could get before warned them get back 
 owner finally disabled which defeats purpose my mind
