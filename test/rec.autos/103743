each valentine hand tuned maximum performance all radar bands
 coverage course adds labor cost turn cost 
unit

i live backyard folks who make stalker radar system 
valentine has saved me many many many times from stealth revenue
enhancement traps local area i have had all major brand detectors
 imho nothing else even comes close v

i dont work valentine i am just satisfied user unit

 you really want nitty gritty details all call nice folks
 valentine research more than happy explain 
perspective radar detection analysis methods 
 calls free 



 seems more more bands available 
police radar each month i have recently purchased within
 last months bel stw while perfect
detector any means does do job fairly well 

now however i pick up car magazine airport 
read about super ka wideband which superset 
 ka wideband latest generation detectors
 touted covering 

so now bel has new series detectors out cover all
 usual bands x k ka photo ka wideband well 
new super ka wideband 

just comes point diminishing returns when chasing
increased pc computing power faster faster cpus 
 average home consumer least seems 
now same concern radar detectors does make sense
 upgrade just months after purchasing my new detector
 valentine upgrading equipment so might 
worth me upgrade valentine i 
market valentine when i purchased bel 
 month waiting time just too much me since i had
inadequate protection my passport life much simpler
when just x k band escort has best
equipment market need continuously
shop new detector i hope flood new radar 
bands ceases new super wideband business
