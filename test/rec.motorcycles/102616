how do i get dod number

 most frequently asked question recmotorcycles what 
dod second most frequently asked question must how do i
get dod number simple asking keeper list
kotl accept substitue keepers number youre feeling
creative your favorite number hasnt been taken already you can
make request subject kotl approval warning nonnumeric non
base number requests likely earn flame from kotl 
 you wont get you pay 

oh just one little tiny suggestion ask kotl email youll
just playing lightning rod flames you post whole
net youll look like clueless newbie too

 now youre probably asking so whos kotl already well 
john sloan notes below thats about only real secret left around
here few unsubtle hints can divulged first myself
nor anyone mentioned name posting maybe though john 
 original kotl second keeping true spirit unix 
kotls first name only two letters long can spelled entirely
 hexadecimal characters kotl shares his name line
oriented text utility third he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new dod numbers mostly boneheads weenie
mailers fourth reason suspect kotl being 
deadhead

 newsflash message from kotl 

once you have surmounted intellectual pinnacle electronically
groveled kotl please keep mind kotl does indeed
work living occasionally must pacify its boss getting
something done your request may languish mailer queue gasp
days perhaps even horrors week two during times 
economic activity part kotls employers sending yet
another copy your request speed processing queue 
just makes longer verification phenominon left 
excersize reader you suspect mailer problems least
annotate subsequent requests indication former request
 submitted lest you assigned multiple numbers what you think
 kotl memorizes list



one more thing kotl says its telepathic powers arent what
 used so provide some information list ya
 typical dod list entry contains number name statecountry 
email address example

ed greencaedgreeneastsuncom

ps while john mentions below net access bike only
requirements dod membership thats strictly true days 
 number denizens who lack one both

 denizens doom bruce tanner dod 

 road rider august reprinted bruces permission

 group motorcyclists gets together does all normal 
things bunch bikers do discuss motorcycles 
motorcycling beverages cleaning fluids baklavah balaclava caltrops 
helmets antifog shields spine protectors aerodynamics threeangle valve
seats bird hits deer whistles good restaurants racing philosophy 
traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double 
entendres culture absence culture first rides friendship 
argue each other plan rides together

 difference between group your local motorcycle club 
although get together just about everyday most have never seen each 
other face face members group live all over known world 
 communicate each other electronically via computer

 computers range from laptops multimillion dollar computer centers 
 people range from college university students hightech industry 
professionals publicaccess electronic bulletinboard users currently 
recmotorcycles pronounced wreckdotmotorcycles its file name 
 groups primary online meeting place carries about articles per 
month read estimated people most frequent 
posters belong motorcycle club denizens doom usually referred 
 dod

 dod started when motorcyclist john r nickerson wrote couple 
parodies designed poke fun motorcycle stereotypes fellow computer 
enthusiast bruce robinson posted articles under pen name denizen 
 doom while later chuck rogers signed off dod nr keeper 
 flame bruce designated dod nr retroactively 
course nickerson originator parodies given dod nr 

 idea motorcycle club organization meetings rules 
appealed many so john sloan dod nr became keeper 
list issuing dod numbers anyone who wanted one date have been 
almost memberships issued people all over united states 
canada well australia new zealand united kingdom france 
germany norway finland

keeper list sloan eventually designed club patch initial run 
 patches sold out immediately profits from went 
american motorcycle heritage foundation another amhf fund raiser 
selling denizens doom pins members started arnie skurow 
few months later again project successful profits were 
donated foundation so far denizens have contributed over 
 ama museum plaque name denizens doom now hangs 
 motorcycle heritage museum

 often possible doders crawl out from behind crts go 
riding together turns out two largest concentrations 
doders centered near denverboulder colorado californias 
silicon valley consequently two major events annual assault 
rollins pass colorado northern versus southern california 
joust

 rideandfeed bike trip over rollins pass followed big 
barbecue dinner concept joust have riders from northern 
california ride south riders from southern california ride north 
meeting predesignated site somewhere middle additional plan 
 hold official denizens doom homecoming conjunction 
 ama heritage homecoming columbus ohio july

though its safe bet denizens doom collective 
communications hub recmotorcycles replace more traditional 
motorcycle organizations those who prowl electronic pathways 
search twowheeled camaraderie its great way kindred spirits 
get together long may flame


live flame flame livecenterbar

 official motto denizens doom refers ease which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would do 
anything like face face insults known flames 
issuing them called flaming flames often start when member 
disagrees something another member has posted over network 
typical sophisticated intelligent form calm reasoned rebuttal would 
something like what incredibly stupid statement you spandexclad 
poseur guarantee five other people reply defense 
 original poster describing just what think you your riding 
ability your cat



 denizens doom saga unfolds

 john sloan dod 

periodically question what dod raised one 
those questions same class why sky blue 
 god why so much suffering world why do
women inevitably tell you youre nice guy just before 
dump you kinds questions steeped mysticism tradition
 philosophy questions have inspired research discussion
 philosophers locker rooms motorcycle service bays 
halls academe generations 

 long long time ago computer time where anything over few
minutes eternity halting problem really problem 
 computer far far away net topologically speaking two
machines same room atlanta might route mail one another
via system chicago chap who wished remain anonymous 
who eventually assigned dod membership wrote satire 
 various personalities flame wars recmotorcycles 
signed denizen doom wishing identify himself he
asked stalwart individual who would fullness time
become dod post him dod really giving whit
about what other people thought generally being right thinking
individual did so flaming other amusements followed 

he who would become holder dod membership thought 
 funniest thing hed seen while being sort pretty
easily amused so he claimed membership denizens doom
motorcycle club started signing his postings his membership
number 

perhaps readers recmotorcycles were struck vision 
motorcycle club dues rules restrictions brand 
make model national origin motorcycle club organized
electronically may well readers were yearning become 
part something would provide them greater identity 
gestalt personality something which whole greater than 
sum its parts could also were all computer nerds who
wear black socks sneakers pocket protectors who just happen
 also love taking risks machines awesome power weight
ratios social outcasts who saw clique would finally open
minded enough accept us members 

 clear case self fulfilling prophesy denizens doom
motorcycle club born club which majority members have
never met one another face face perhaps like way yet
feel know one another pretty well well enough given some
 electronic personalities newsgroup club organized
 run loosest sense word volunteers through 
network via electronic news mail membershipmailing list
often used organize group rides amongst members who live 
same region motto logo series photo albums circulating
around country organized dod club patches organized 
 even mtvstyle music video produced 
distributed vhs 

where end who knows dod start sanctioning races
placing limits memory clock rate onboard engine
management computers dod organize poker runs where each
participant collects hand hardware software reference cards
 dod have rally which attendees demand terminal
room least sized unix system only time tell 

 dod has dues rules requirements other than net
access love motorcycles become member one need only
ask although we admit who you must ask one few
really good club secrets new members receive via email 
membership number latest copy membership list which
includes name state email address 

 denizens doom motorcycle club live forever least
until next year when we may decided change name 

 live flame flame live

rogers organizing recmotorcycles photo album many copies were made
 several sets were sent tours around world only vanish 
unknown locations bruce tanner decided would appropriate
 electronic medium have electronic photo album bruce has 
only provided disk space ftp email access he has taken
 time scan most photos available from archive

 motorcycles few nonphoto files available from 
server too include dod membership list dod yellow pages
