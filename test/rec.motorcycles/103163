pushing right side my handlebars send me left

 should 
really

id send 

im sure others take up slack


 
andy infante i sometimes wish people would put little more emphasis 


oh lord where i came 

obcountersteer some reason ive discovered pulling 
wrong side handlebars rather than pushing other wrong
side you get my meaning provides feeling greater control 
example rather than pushing right side lean right turn 
right hi lonny pulling left side least until i get leaned
over right feels more secure less counterintuitive maybe
i need psychological help

obcountersteer vanyone else find ironic weekendanda

first day riding
