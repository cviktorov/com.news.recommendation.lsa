what general rule thumb sobriety cycling couple hours after
you feel sober what should i just work i drink tonight i

 thread brings back memorys expensive day traffic court
 few years ago while i waiting my turn state my case 
plea why i going my cage i had opportunity
 listen some creative excuses offered judge others

after listening number well i passing very slow truck
 suddenly speed up versions i decided judge had heard
just about every story book some he less than
impressed any them

 young rather burley looking guy had his docket read 
rather drill sargent looking ohio state highyway patrol trooper
he clocked riding motorcycle speed mph mph
zone also noted defendant motorcycle rider had
alcohol his breath cited offence

 judge looked over his half glasses purched end his nose
 said his sternest voice well son those some pretty
fast speeds riding motorcycle what do you have say 
your self

well sir meekly defenant replied i just over my
buddys we had couple beers i my way home
he offered nothing more less just had couple beers 
 doing mph his way home

 judge moved simplicity response fined him 
maximum case plus court costs course ordered him
 attend remedial drivers training school
