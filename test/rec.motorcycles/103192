 what general rule thumb sobriety cycling couple hours 
 after you feel sober what should i just work i drink

 hrdrink first drinks
 hoursdrink next drinks
 hoursdrink rest

i took alcohol servers class few years ago what hey my employer
paid 

we were told drink hour rule written proof booze
 pound person mind drinking cuervo gold weighing 
i obviously get drunk faster than theoretical person mentioned
above worse imagine rum coke made bacardi 

mind you all thats getting too drunk drive car i may only
have been riding month so i plan my evenings very
rigid exclusive statement either dont drink dont ride
pretty simple

 
 fairly cautious guidelines work even you happen 
 have low tolerance body mass
 i think cops dont you dare drink drive tm commercials 
 usually say hrdrink general after about drinks hrs you 
 could very well over legal limit 
 watch yourself

sorry mike i have believe policy works best fertilizer
