 hey works you could present paragraph above virtually any member
 nonmotorcycling public theyll buy right 
 
 just about any argument you can produce favor banning helmetless
 riding can used argue favor banning motorcycles
 its just matter degree

thats absurd statement must therefore say any argument favor
 seatbelts airbags argument against automobiles any argument
 lifeguards argument against swimming says any agrgument
 favor safety precautions argument banning activity 
which precautions apply extrapolating degree ridiculous
 wouldnt any normal human activity left do therefore 
 nonseqitur

also even though most people do ride motorcycles do boat sail
jetski climb ski fly parachute hangglide glide bungeejump bike
skate rollerblade skateboard play rugby ouch mow lawn rewire
 basement operate heavy machinery do host other dangerous
things would all valid motorcycling activities ban
your little homily applies all those things general public
buying banning motorcycles without realizing activity
would next unlikely
