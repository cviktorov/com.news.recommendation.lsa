 chp black white gas station jameson canyon road 
officer stated looked like you were going kinda fast coming down
highway you must have been going least i just said okay

 can you beat ticket personally i think its your duty citizen
 make much trouble possible them so maybe theyll give up
 leave us alone someday soon

accountability
