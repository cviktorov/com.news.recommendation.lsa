my old jacket about bite dust so im market new riding
jacket im looking recommendations suitable replacement i would
like buy full aerostich suit i cant afford right now

im considering two basic options

 buy aerostich jacket only dunno how much costs
 due recent price increases id imagine over 
 may pushing my limit advantages include fact
 i can later add pants nearly eliminates
 need jacket portion rainsuit

 buy some kind leather jacket i like few new 
 heingericke firstgear line however may bit pricey
 unless i can work some sort deal advantages leather
 potentially slightly better protection enhanced pose
 value we all know how important possibly cheaper
 than upper aerostich

requirements jacket must fit over few other 
layers mainly sizing thing leather id prefer zipout 
lining must have some body armor similar aerostich elbows 
shoulders forearms possibly backkidney protection etc 
reasonable amount pocket space would nice ventilation would 
 plus however must wearable cold weather below
freezing layers perhaps electrics
