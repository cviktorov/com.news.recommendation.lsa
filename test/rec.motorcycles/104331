now i am jumping middle thread so i may know
what yall been talking about i have few comments

 unless engine supercharged pressure available force
air intake tract atmospheric time intake
valve opened pressure differential available move air only
 difference between combustion chamber pressure left over after
 exhaust stroke atmospheric piston decends 
intake stroke combustion chamber pressure decreased allowing
atmospheric pressure move more air intake tract time
does pressure ever become negative even approach good
vacuum

 number other factors very important three
biggest being air velocity air momentum shock waves
velocity stacks have been used years now being used inside
 stock airboxes number bikes tuned engine rpm 
stacks can greatly increase speed thus momentum air
rushing 
air momentum critical getting good air intake momentum 
 air stack outside combustion chamber force its way inside
long after piston has begun its compressive upstroke
shock waves used induce air intake prevent fresh air from
escaping out exzhaust ports shock waves product expansion
chambers any other means presenting wall opening closing
 air motion beyond i am lost mystery how 
design shock waves
