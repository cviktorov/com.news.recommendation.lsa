we all seem agreement two explanations why
one can use handlebars lean moving motorcycle question 
 one effect dominant which one idea would 
design experiment which would seaprate two characteristics 
see which effect produces similar result one which those 
us who have bikes familiar

 you point out experiments would difficult we know
enough about physics situation do some calculations
 fact three effects contributing leaning bike over
 begin turn

 gyro effect causing torque which twists bike over

 contact patch having shifted one side causing bike fall over

 contact patch being accelerated side causing 
torque which twists bike over

take average bikerider average bike wheel speeds 
 mph say calculate how much twist bars would 
needed produce say degrees lean say seconds each
effect alone my guess slow speeds dominant 
high speeds dominant all speeds contributes far off
bugger all relatively speaking

 way similar problem how does runner who wants 
run round corner get leaned corner fast running
group where we could start counterfooting arguments have them
all falling over tried work out how go round corners
