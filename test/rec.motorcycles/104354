better still reverse sequence hit bugger under accelleration
 stabilise yourself i hate things attack me 
 dog thinks you have run away has established dominance over 
 funny noisy sheep things attack every bike comes 
along fun you can hurt bugger learns 
 below bikes peck order you may have saved life 
future biker whose evasive action avoid dog might otherwise put 
him under truck never avoid dog dogs sake only youre own 

 i hate admit does seem some sort twisted logic
 approach its bikers against world dogs just 
another worthless adversary so remember wear least calf height leather
boots case dog gets lucky sinks his teeth your
attacking foot go gusto dog doesnt retreat from 
street his tail between his legs next time you see you really
havent done your bit all your fellow bikers

 also applies cages

sorry i cant go far dog against armored cage just doesnt
seem like fair fight

 dog out control menace all road users 
compunction should felt ensuring your safety means destruction 
its after all forcing game you

after all dog eat dog world
