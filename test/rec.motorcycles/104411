insurance companies sure seem go nofault coverage since 
majority accidents cagers fault doesnt imply we
would have pay much higher rates under nofault system

 carsonly system seems make sense surface take 
legal costs out system looks like motorcyclists would
get screwed

yup unfortunately has been pointed out cost insurance
does go down fault crappiest drivers make out like bandits
because longer have bear responsibility paying 
insurance have boosted price themselves being crappy
drivers good drivers now pay through nose spread cost 
 crappy drivers actions thats fair

any plan caps rates crappy drivers inherently piece 
shit because rest us end up paying more

any plan uses speeding tickets basis raising rates 
also piece shit based upon lie faster drivers 
inherently less safe than slower drivers nhtsa disproved two
years ago now

later
