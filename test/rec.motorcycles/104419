yo whaz up

earlier i reading net about using splitfire plugs one
guy thinking about almost everybody shot him hell well
i saw one think someone said about show me team used split
fires well heres some additional insight some theories
about splitfire plugs how boost us oppossed cages

splitfires were originally made burn fuel more efficiently 
increased power x cages well guys splitfires
increased performance increasing torque werent focusing
 horsepower numbers

now how does related us high performance pilots well 
depends do you pilot high performance cylinder machine
 case cylinders splitfires would increase overall torque
 s make more top end horsepower its torque packed down low
so s splitfires would significantly increase power

 what about twins many you guys laugh some us twins
 many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up 
 hp loss see doug polen vs scott russell daytona however
twins make more torque thoughout powerbands so how does 
translate increased torque should theoretically help twins make
more power splitfire claims should extra mods
 anything made just stick em 

now i dont know about all im trying catch up 
somebody about now splitfires should help twins more than
s 

 far racing teams ducati team fast ferraci used
splitfires season when had jamie james
running em i dont know why stopped since 
also somebody check see had them
