 question day re passenger helmets you dont know 
certain whos gonna ride you like say you meet them church 
meeting yeah thats ticket what some guidelines should i just 
pick up another shoei my size have backup helmet xl should i 
maybe get inexpensive one smaller size accomodate my likely 
passenger 

 your primary concern protecting passenger event 
crash have him her fitted helmet size your
primary concern complying stupid helmet laws carry real big
spare you can put big small head big helmet 
small one

 well you can accomplish both goals actually you have definite
physical type mind when you go cough church meetings 
your tastes tend smaller more petite cough churchgoers more
likely have smaller head you can safely get medium
 small helmet

 works me i traded my spare large helmet my best friend
who tends look more women over cant
usually fit medium size helmet he previously had

 course you arent picky what size cough churchgoers you give
helpful motorcycle rides eds advice hopefully cover any
eventuality far legality concerned spare handtowel 
tankbag makes acceptable padding so passenger can see out viewport
rather than padding above viewport cases extreme mismatch
