sorry i lost attributions
 most areas drivers required show proof financial 
responsibility which usually means insurance 

required how when get pulled over most drivers bellyaching 
net aside dont get pulled over checked laws enforceable
only after fact which case often somebody out lot money

dont you have any requirement yearly plate stickers us 
ontario manitoba sure other provinces i think you have
 show proof insurnace when you renew your plate ie get new sticker

yes unfortunately also concept owner car
 responsible actions any authorized user car
thats one biggest arguments against photoradar ticketing
systems

you also get pay all outstanding tickets even have cross province
agreements least between ontario quebec so unpaid tickets 
 other province record having up date sticker bad

trouble you have recourse misissued ticket
 clerical error computer follow you around city chicago
 informal motto which being city works issues dozens
 parking tickets each year people who have never set foot tire
 city
