hello everyone im new motorcycles so flames please i dont
have my bike yet so i need few pieces information

 any stories how you all learned

ill tell you my story example what do

early i took some riding lessons from my college roommate 
his old honda cbt he had taken msf beginners course so i
actually learned some what i needed know ride

i proceeded buy beatup honda cl helmet 
rode around wearing cotton windbreaker i decided 
invest fullface helmet first smart move sometime around 
i also passed my road test

 may i got caught rainstorm my way home from 
mile trip entering town where i lived rather urban suburb
i had stop suddenly red light i noticed too late
skidded rear tire out ejected face upward 
oncoming lane traffic fortunately me oncoming traffic 
also stopped same red light otherwise i might have slid under
 car been killed

now anecdotal evidence sure i later took 
experienced rider course from msf saw earlier training
could have helped me greatly your case need even greater
since you have nobody help you practice even most basic stuff
 i did

so my advice take msf beginners course first thing i
wouldnt even buy bike until youve taken course unless you
happen pick up real good deal can store someplace until
youre ready use 

 i only have about work so would have 
 cover everything bike helmet anything else im too 
ignorant know i need buy

while youre waiting take course might take few weeks 
dc i recall were always waiting lists boston could you
save up some more money start out right say riding gear
plus cost bike plus maybe guess mechanic make sure
 machine safe assuming you economize buying some old beatup
machine from private individual plus insurance plus registration
 licensing fees plus course youre looking maybe 
including bike itself reserve ongoing maintenance

 what buying bike going do my insurance i turn 
about month so my parents have been taking care my insurance up
till now i need comprehensive list costs buying 
motorcycle going insure i live washington dc makes
 difference

i pay about insurance now upstate ny closer 
 boston more urban decent insurance including substantial
coverage liability which you want unless you plan always 
poor id guess dc more like boston than like rural area ergo
more expensive

 any recommendations what i should buywhere i should look 

 used annual buyers guides usual motorcycle
magazines i found those helpful getting idea what new 
recent models might available you could probably look through
past issues size up what used bikes might available my first
bike years old when i bought so i went my friends advice
instead also look bikes you see people riding 
 parked street i basically settled my present bike 
noticing were lot highmileage bmws running around
 were generally set up way i wanted

nothing wrong talking various dealers your area visiting
showrooms dealers boston area least when i shopping
were very nice about letting you look around showrooms 
quoting prices bikes werent latest models hence
cheaper although i ended up buying both bikes private sales
