 having talked couple people about helmets dropping im getting 
about dont sweat you might think about replacing 
other dont ride go without helmet first
 
 any way tell helmet damaged structurally i dropped 
about feet cement off my seat chipped paint didnt seem 
screw up actual shell 

id bet price helmet its okayfrom feet
 higher maybe 

 i dont end up replacing real near future would i do better 
 wear my totally nondamaged face dotrated cheapie which doesnt fit 
 well keep out wind well wearing shoei rf which 
lot more comfortable keeps wind out better quieter might 
have some minor damage

id wear full facer id way more worried
about wind blast face inability hear police
sirens than helmet being little damaged


 also what would you all reccomend far good helmets im slightly 
disappointed how badly shoei has scratched etc from being 
bloody careful about how little impact took chip paint 
 arguably mess up period looking really good fullface 
good venting wind protection i like shoei style kinda like 
norton one i saw awhile back too suspect im going have get 
much more expensive helmet i want replace every time im 
being careful where i set down

well my next helmet subject fitting well agv
sukhoi thats just because i like looks my current one 
 shoei task its getting little old i crashed 
 once couple years ago hard impact headmy hip
took care price consideration id get
 kiwi k i hear both good cheap

 christ i dont treat my head carefully i treated shoei far 
tossing down i dont have any bruises 

 mildly mildly paranoid about helmet dont get
carried away people net like those you
mentioned do consistently live our planet
