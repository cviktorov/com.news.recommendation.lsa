 all i am saying you dont even need tell people 
technique countersteering cos do intuitively first
time try go round corner

some others steer tuchuses i dont know how much
 teaching countersteering beginner course really helps 
tuchus steerers i one i guess i always steered bicycle way
 i only got hang countersteering normal riding after course
i could do countersteering swerves course problem i only
started using my normal riding when i decided my turning speed
offramps like lot more difficult should have been
i knew how works although thats currently up debate definitely knew
 works i could do swerves only figured out later
 my normal riding just data point i think its bad idea 
bring idea up its best let everyone tuchussteer first
lesson two so can learn shift gears before have worry
about proper handlebar technique

countersteering fact my experienced rider course instructors
claimed could get behind new rider make bike
turn whichever side wanted just shifting weight
around even when operator trying turn opposite
direction i admit ive never actually seen 

i have our beginner course we had passenger training sometime during
 lesson instructor would hop back bike student
would take him ride student did give instructor 
you sack potatoes passenger speech instructor would steer
 bike make general nuisance himself amusing watch
im just happy didnt happen me

ive bike like jody levine dod kv
 got you can you pf jodyplevinehydroonca
