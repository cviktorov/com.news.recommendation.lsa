well looks like im fcked insurance

i had dwi beemer rec
vehicle itll cost me almost bucks insureyear

now what do i do

sell bike car start taking bus way you can
keep drinking which seems where your priorities lay

i expect enough us list have lost friends because 
driving drunks our collective sympathy somewhat muted

look guy i doubt anyone here approves drunk driving 
hes been caught convicted punished maybe you ought 
lighten up i mean isnt like most us havent had few
 ridden driven home we just didnt get caught
 i can speak myself say never happen again
 beside point

 answer original poster id insure whatever vehicle
 cheapest can get you from work suffer
through few years til your rates drop

 dont drink drive i had one friend killed 
drunk i rear ended one totaling my bike bent
frame only failing kill me because i had eye
 my mirror while i waited stoplight
