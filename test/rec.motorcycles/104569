 sure you can do wheelies shaft drive bike i had bmw rrs
 wheelie monster course didnt have initial power
burst just twist air i had pop clutch i also
had replace front fork seals few times well fairing 
bit heavy slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all 
time let me give you fair warning i trashed ringpinion gear
 final drive my k i assume doing wheelies 
 cheap fix either some kind slip device shaft
 prevent from breaking unfortunately didnt save gears

up about feet off ground traffic light i dont recommend 
activities anymore now im old guy kids my own
