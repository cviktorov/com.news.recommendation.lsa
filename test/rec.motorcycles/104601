 apartment complex where i used live tried only put 
 thing over drivers window so couldnt miss 

i can see liability putting stickers car while moving
 something its bdi chooses start drive car
 known unsafe condition would seem liable 

 effort made remove sticker came pieces leaving
most firmly attached window dark around
 pm sticker before being mangled ineffective attempt
 torn off warned car would towed removed 
reasonable person would arguably have driven car had 
accident occured i dont think my friends attorney would have much
trouble fixing blame apartment mangement

 practical matter even without conviction cost 
inconvenience defending against suit would considerable

 moral matter pretty fucking stupid thing do so
paltry violation parking without authorization sticker btw 
wasnt somebodys spot residentonly unassigned
parking


ed green former ninjaite i drinking last night biker
 edgreeneastsuncom i showed him picture you i said
dod go get know her youll like her
 grateful dead seemed like least i could do
