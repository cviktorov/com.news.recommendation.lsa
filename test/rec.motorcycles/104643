gse its great bike youd better damn careful 
i got my third motorcycle 
deleta
 bike light its size i think its pounds heavy 
beginner bike

heavy beginner bike pounds isnt except maybe 
some admans dream full tank its area lbs
depending year etc

youre you should have problem physically managing
 seat roughly akin plasticcoated very firm very
painful depending upon time saddle

 versions had much better seat imo

 bike suffers from infamous suzuki regulator problem i have so far
avoided forking out roughly suzuki part kludging 
different honda regulatorrectifier units from junkyards charging system
consistently overcharges battery i have refill nearly weekly
 itself so bad battery access gained only after removing
 seat tank airbox

my regulator lasted over miles didnt overcharge battery
 wiring connectors charging path did get toasty though
tending melt insulation i suspect were underspecified
 didnt help were well removed from cool air

battery access earlier bikes doesnt require tank removal
after you learn drill its pretty straightforward


replacement parts like all suzuki parts outrageously expensive

having bought replacement parts several brands motorcycles
ill offer grain salt taken dales assessment


good luck careful
