well few you so aptly put 
get off road jerk we dont wanna hear your 
whining

fine

fuck off too

 you noticed more than two years ago
 yes ive learned its cost me

 yes ive known people friends relatives whove
been involved drunkrelated accidents them were hit
 my cousin still recovering

 i cant take back what happened

yes stupid

 reminding me about all time youre
neither helping me yourself so stuff your opinion

hey man you brought up i agree completely driving drunk really
stupid i understand appreciate you feel bad about 
dwi endemic our society real problem we 
motorcyclists can worst vulnerable positions around drunk
driver alert readers might remember last year i witnessed dwi
accident right bloody front me unable save life 
 one participants i reported here also drunk driving 
motorcyclists prime cause injury death which raises 
insurance rates forces stupidly restrictive laws turns public
against those us who ride responsibly

 my view drunk driving should carry mandatory prison sentence
 one traffic offenses which public funds issue
 genuine safety issue so you bring up subject recmoto
admitting having been caught dwi looking sympathy over 
consequences dont expect people respond warm wishes

dave svoboda svobodavoidrtsgmotcom im getting tired 

you beav should lighten up esp beav i agree 
duidwi serious we should have reasonable laws strict
enforcement tough sentences andrew did 
post looking sympathy over consequences he posted
asking advice because he had extremely high quote his
post obviously valid because he later found insurance less
he noted why he his predicament did defend 
any way drunk driving has renounced drunk driving 
 too many repeat offenders worry about other bdc
why try make person who longer part problem
 outcast he has paid his debt society step off high
horse we have all been irresponsible past

 said im guilty same type hostility towards
rapists i think comes because i feel punishment 
severe enough same may true dwidui 
case our stinkin gubment we need change 
we had reasonable law about dwidui stiff penalty
 fewer people would do 

 any rate andrew paid his debt defined law
 you think debt actually greater than law mandates 
tell your representatives
