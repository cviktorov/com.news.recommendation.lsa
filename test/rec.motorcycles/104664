 i need some advice having someone ride pillion me my ninja
 first time ive taken anyone extended ride
 read farther than around block well riding some twisty 
 fairly bumpy roads mines roadmthamilton loop you sf bay areans

communication work out your own system just slow down holler
back every once while reasonable speeds even my undermuffled
magna we can hear each other its only above say mph you 
cant really communicate

balance new passengers real pain because you never know how
theyre going react steering some people catch immediately
 lean me others completely skittish about leaning
thing keep bodies perpendicular horizon 
pain while turning manageable worst passengers who stay
perpendicular horizon remember middle turn
 whip around until theyre correct position always
screws up line ive picked out

heres my personal checklist things tell passengers
 attire helmet long pants bootsheavy shoes jacket
 keep feet pegs all times unless i say otherwise do 
 get onoff unless i say you can ive had people try dismount
 traffic just im pulling parking space
 muffler gets hot nuff said
 we get good traction were going fall over many
 firsttime riders surprised how tightly you can turn
 turn dynamics sit so you feel like youre sitting upright 
 were going straight trust your butt your eyes youre
 confused close your eyes couple turns get feel
 just hug me tight 
 please sudden moves shift your weight desired 
 gradual so i can compensate
 your faceplate yours openclose desired
 trust essential trust driver me do right 
 thing ive driven many miles thing know how
 operate enjoy ride important 
 stress example one my firsttime passwngers seemed 
 watch speedo like hawk i drove her beach down 
 whever we topped mph shed holler slow down im scared 
 i humored her while simply covered speedometer 
 spare piece duct tape i keep stuck top cluster
 problem solved she watched scenery instead 
 instruments had much better time based her
 experience driving lincoln continental she unwilling 
 trust my ability choose safe speed bike

usually ill point out controls engine transmission brakes 
tires etc discuss motorcycle physics bit too firsttimers
helps calm nerves gives bike chance warm up

watch out gravel mt hamilton road were lots little
mudslides after last big rain now many blind corners 
 nicely covered carpet little round nearly invisible stones
 doesnt help build trust when you slide out blind corner 
first trip

good luck have fun

dont drink soap dilute dilute ok
