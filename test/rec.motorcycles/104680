 extended ride passenger ninja

owww

well i hate wet sock well

i passenger many bikes longest time before i started
riding myelf i grew hate long rides sport bikes passenger
seats designed long rides passenger positions arent
even usually designed short rides i ended up torturing my knees my
back taking long rides passenger sport bikes one 
reasons i originally liked my current guythingy so much becase he had
 bmw 

id suggest shorter extended ride first short turn mountains
 some see how much pain shes proceed from 

 best advice id give beginning passenger

 dont get bike until rider says its ok work out some sort
 signal rider tell you when its ok get off after i get 
 bike i squeeze my riders hips tell im ready stop
 he nods his head show its ok me get off

 keep your feet pegs all times dont wiggle unless your rider
 asks you 

 best passengers those which unobtrusive echo movements
 lean your rider look over shoulder thats most comfortable
 during turns look over shoulder inside turn

 get used your riders shifting style riders use reasonably
 consistent shifting style avoid helmet bonk helmet bonk 
 when your rider revs bike up shifts sudden change
 foreward acceleration causes your helmet bonk hishers 
 gets old real fast

 when pulling stop put hand both hands tank keep
 your weight from pushing your rider up onto tank putting your hands
 tank also good way stretch your back youre pain
 im told gets harder steer turns you leave them 

 switch your hands guardrail stretch your shoulders 
 sure squeeze your thighs while youre doing so your rider knows youre
 still guard rail isnt safe holding onto your rider

 dont afraid ask frequent stops youre pain 
 losing feeling your feet passenger seats generally designed 
 comfort work out some sort pull over signal beforehand
