i have cheap solar charger i keep my car i purchased via
some mail order catalog when year old battery my oldsmobile would
run down during summer when i riding my bike more than driving my car
knowing id selling car year so i purchased charger
believe thing worked battery held charge 
energetically started car many times after weeks just
sitting

eventually i had purchase new battery anyway because winter sun
wasnt strong enough due its low angle

i think i paid charger more powerful more
expensive ones i purchased cheapest one i could find

ive never used bike because i have ez charger 
keep plugged all time bike garaged
