greetings recmotorcyclists

coming up labour day weekend year worldcon world science fiction
convention held san francisco california i am planning
 attend have been speculating doing my trip motorcycle
instead plane my initial thought 

i live would departing from ottawa ontario canada

i had planned take two weeks trip giving me days travel
time either side weekend

 looks like distance about miles km

 your distance calc correct road distance 
 crow flies km day days you spend 
entire time interstates which would total waste time thats
 least hours road every day including eatingpeeing
sightseeing etc

i contemplating similar trip from ottawa la 
maybe ottawa austin tx 

i figured i wanna do trip magnitude enjoy id
have get my ass off major interstates spend lots 
time enjoying country around me ie stopping camera
meeting townspeople going few bars sense spending weeks
looking out helmet closest human contact found gas
pump

i estimated id need least weeks make trip worthwhile

i am looking input opinions comments snarky remarks 
 my sanity

 question 

 suggested routes note getting important my
 schedule doesnt leave lot room side trips circuitous
 routes

try stay off interstates

 anybody who wants join me trip even part 
 distance

depending your route my plans i may heading way far
 least detroit

 anything comes mind you think might relevant
