i am having trouble starting keeping running my cbrf i have
had problems since last year seemed have subsided now
its back again problem persists regardless choke usage pattern
gasoline type brand octane pretty much anything else i can imagine
 change dealer stumped its still under warranty

i start bike runs great while seconds engine
starts slow down decreasing idle setting increase engine
speed increasing choke increases engine speed regardless 
engine eventually slow down stop 

once stopped restart even after flooded engine drill 
i let sit minutes starts beautifully runs great ever
so i go out ride hard miles bring back ride easy 
 few miles let cool down put away

next day i go thru same drill get going

any ideas has anyone seen before

another f rider had similiar problems mail i sent him
hope helps resolve you problem

 check vent tube tank sometimes tube clogged constricted
 prevents gas from flowing carbs because vacuum created 
 displacement gasoline small tube bottom 
 tank large tube overflow you have remove left side
 tail section get access area 
 
 good luck
 
 clogged wouldnt interfere engine operation all
 time when runs runs well 
 
good point did catch original post only other things 
which come mind since gravity feed fuel system 
 fuel petcock valve vacuum controlled from carburator let
suppose small hole bad seal either hose itself 
vacuum valve fuel petcock when cold hole open enough
 open valve just enough allow gas carbs choke 
since choke creates more low pressure carbs when draw gas 
 engine surrounding area warm up hole seals up 

one way check fuel flow through valve would pull side 
panels off remove fuel hose carbs connect tube 
correct size preferably clear tubing observe fuel flow output
side fuel petcock remove control hose from carburator make
sure tank full place valve position apply vacuum 
 control hose preferably vacuum device gauge check 
 air leaks vacuum applied fuel should flow freely see 
 vent problem do fuel filler cap open closed 
flows lot faster filler cap open may something 
 vent airway which changes position depending position may clog 
 partially clog vent i have heard some f fuel tanks being replaced 
 fix problem so things which might defective control
hose from carb petcock valve possibly fuel tank vent

now all above shows problem fuel flow when cold 
 something carbs screwed up so many things check 
i would typing all day list them all 

here few everything back together apply vacuum petcock valve
 open drain holes carbs one one check fuel flow open up 
airbox check foreign debris clogged airways carbs 
quite few each carb

i hope something flushed out all trouble shooting american
honda does resolve get mad hell report them bbb 
call honda customer service hotline number i dont recall
 off top my head i called just about tires my f few days
later customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived home asking how i liked
 support i received here would your chance tell them what you think

buy service manual f invaluable source information
 working your bike i might add trouble shooting
