any lock including kyptonite utypes easy break person has
 proper supplies andor motivation minutes your bike gone
i would glad explain i dont want contribute any unlawful
activities 

does make anyones skeptic alarm tm go off offense bill i
dont mean say youre being straight i wonder how you
know about have you actually every used your secret method break
all different kinds bike locks you taking someones word
 

 fact unlikely someone reading anything here going 
go successful bikestealing business because read anything 
recmotorcycles so please tell us what you talking about we cant
even protect against assault discuss methods you dont come out
 

see i have heard ones about pipes liquid nitrogen 
cordless dremel tools bunch other ones most plausable method
i am bike thief so i really dont know certain just put
 rod through each wheel use four guys just lift bike 
truck works because most people dont lock bikes anything
since method so childishly easy i figure nice visible chain 
cable locking bike something likely make lazy thief go 
 next bike

hey finally advantage weight high cg concours 

especially since i have bike i would hate see ripped off
 trival tactic warning lock alone safe deterent against theft
 thief doesnt need locksmith lockpicker walk away your
property i personally think motion alarms combination lock
 type way go fact you concerned

what tactic you referring we dont know what you talking about
we cant very well guard against can we

 my money literally i rely combination motiondetector alarm
 pager when im out earshot bike questionable area cc
insurance i try park obvious visible areas lots people
about see someone just plays bike without intention 
stealing least some eyes get too rambunctious
theyll set off alarm

thats nice bike ratbike trick always keep its
actual value well below bluebook so looks so crappy nobody would
want steal even were stupid enough you would make
 profit deal 

seriously i instance need go business trip week
 sadly have leave bikes sitting both get shittylooking
 useable cover locked both bikes locked each other 
curb bumper parking lot under light i usually rig cable
locks i use aircraft cable so anyone pulls either bike 
 cable joining them concours alarm goes off i have friend
come buy every day have look make sure theyre still 
only thing i have ever had stolen cover over 
winter storage battery out bike thus alarm

oh put your own eyelets cover locks pass through 
place them so have absolutely destroy cover get off

thats best i can think most locks i see people put
 bikes look well too mechanically sound i like abus since i have
personally removed master locks from lockers my boot
