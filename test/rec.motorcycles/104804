rider education responsibility over last tentwenty years
 i am still amazed anytime i teach erc how many people many

mike everything else hard braking swerving tend mutually exclusive
mike manouvres did hurt draw any conclusions which one generally
mike preferable

 specific recommandation cited hurt study formal
street strategy like sipde example most important
component any rider education curriculum specific skills 
emergency braking cornering swerving must taught practiced
 well more significant rider did nothing
confronted potential accident another third collided 
fell over result rider error choice specific maneuver
 much less significant outcome than early detection 
 proper execution any effective countermeasure
