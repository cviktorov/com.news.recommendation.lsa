 traffic citation accusation having committed crime
 thats why have go through motions having trial you
 want one you still innocent until proven guilty cops 
 only ones who can accuse people committing crimes anyone who
 witnesses crime can do so
 
 go highway patrol explain situation give them 
 description car license number tell them 
 specific violation law which you witnessed wish prosecute
 ie search vehicle code have section number handy fill
 out ticket sign go through same system any
 ticket cop writes goes through contested you have 
 appear court prosecute your word carry same weight
 cops
 
 indeed advice i got from police officer when i had my
 close call without additional impartial witnesses 
 would my word vs other drivers up me
 decide whether time inconvenience me worth 
 time inconvenience other driver also whether any
 positive effect would result beyond making me feel better

my worth i did once bdi ladycager town car passed me 
 right two lane road i memorized her license plate 
days before i carried pen paper my tankbag went local
police station cops filled out ticket i signed she paid
