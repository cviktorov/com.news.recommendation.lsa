hi

im sure what other guy cant track down his post his name
 talking about when he made claim cobralinks adjustable
 theres space between each link where teeth 
locking head notch thus each link possible locking point

also applicable hardcore thieves who cart around
liquid nitrogen oxyacetylene torches cobralinks look lot
more effective than kryptonite cable locks imho i think initial
appearance effect more relevant boredjoyridersnominallyadeptat
crackingunsecuredbike deterrence long lock nominally 
functional

finally i notice when i ride my leathers harness boots 
 cobralinks slung across like bandolier btw ive crashed rain
dressed like lock didnt pulverize any vertebrae cagers give
me much wider berth dont hassle me tend avoid any potentially
inflammatory action stoplights

i love my cobralinks almost much i love my pres honda dinosaur
i think i have pavlovian drool reflexi put lock ie my
body i can feel bike already shaking away
