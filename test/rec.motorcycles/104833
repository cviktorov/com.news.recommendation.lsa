force down dogs throat dog would naturally gag release become
momentarily disoriented commonly happens humans when we go doctor 
have our throats examined proof positive time during dogs
disorientation next move would wrap arm about dog throat 
choke hold manner constrict all your might until dog lapses 
unconsciousness from lack oxygen halting blood flow finally run like
 wind get away from local area should dog get up again really
