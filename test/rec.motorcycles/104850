well i wrong i sat st both feet down all i could 
think big i put one foot up heavy came mind very
quickly cindy back she back hard 
tell seat three times large hawk seat bike seemed
nearly out control just idling side road

 heavy mid s dry one major drawback
 st

 rpm second gear all weight seemed dissappear even

can you say tourque monster test drive sold me bike 
lots bite anywhere above any gear

 bike miles odometer slippery new tires pads 

did you trythe abstcs version 

cindy has difficulty speed rd gear th gear purring along
 top gear thing has less low rpm grunt my hawk lane 
changes were new experience big heft required move 
thing responds well though wallowing complaint behind 
fairing fairly quiet helmet buffeting 

after market fairing windshield raises bubble inches
above most heads hurts looks bike

nontrivial top gear car passing mph nearly effortless
smooth smooth smooth sure what v sound reminds me 
 pleasant 

 essence bike move throttle itr accelerates 
any gear anywhere anytime i frequently find myself dod min 
during casual passing maneuver

 jump caused me less than impressed 
brakes its down hill reversing camber twicereversing radius
decreasing radius turn real squeeze needed front binder 
 function weight you have aggresive brake
squeze actually tested cycle world expert rider st
stopped faster comparable models from bmw yamaha even 
 extra weight gas 
 section we were tight too urban st works ok
 section shows its weight we went clam shack

you must countersteer st every turn movement short
 classic pothole wiggle just forget ever leaning 
turn again must countersteered every turn 
responds nicely

about half way through onramp i yanked cindys wrist our singal
 hold tight head check left time find redline second
gear gives good shove third too fourth sees dod speed 
short shift top way we saw cops very light
traffic did cross dod zone because bike too new
well now had miles so ok tried some high effort
lane changes some wide sweeping turns time wick up i went 
until buffeting threating pull us off seat stayed
 when i comfortable wind steering 
i looked down find indicated mph bad up touring

faster ive ever gone i d hate buy bike after your 
short break period


 thread st through cars edge concrete pad
out front heavy took way too much effort cindy i put
 thing center stand i am sure i used side
stand st would have been its side within minute

 true side stand well designed weight hold 
 bike nicely dirt i am able easily get bike up 
 center stand just step down stand instead pulling
up bike

my demo opinion heavy put diet smooth comfortable
hardly notices dod speed id buy about less than 
list just like too much bike 

keep looking left overs available going 
i love mine i havent found better value st 
remember you get years unlimited mileage warranty
