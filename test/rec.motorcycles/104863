re cecil kings nominating statement 

dear chick

owners news words nearly twice many permitted 
 bylaws pertinent part rules state

each candidates biography position statement shall limited 
 combined total more than words nominating committe shall cut afafter th word any biography position statement exceeding length

 obviously nominationg committe up task had cecils
statement been cut required would have concluded approximately 
 word undertiding sic second paragraph after commencement
 his position statement result cecil has obtained what i view 
grossly unfair advantage over other candidates president does
 just taint election office makes mockery 
process i would appreciate your advising board immediately what steps
you intend take rectify caricature fair election
 parenthetically your private correspondence others i would
 most appreciative when tou call me asshole you remind 
letters recipient republication comment almost
guaranteed have woeful consequences
