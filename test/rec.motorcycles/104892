 would shame split boxer riders between different lists
 unless course existing list failed meet readers
 needs
you presumed you needed split out gs list
 implication your split plain ol bmw
list wouldnt meet gs riders needs

good point list actually started out extension my gs
v fj shootout list which why got name since inception
however other boxerinterested folks have joined conversation
has always been geared gspdstspecific topics

 sake forcing split issue
how about changing charter renaming
your list from bmwgs just bmw would 
make everybody happy

when i raised expand expandthat question
question list itself were mixed feelings list has
always been open anyone nonbouncing from line 
has been general agreement only boxerrelated stuff 
appropriate almost all subscribers own rr gsstpd
bikes although some r rt rs owners also 

 point my main interest list preserve peace
 comraderie while same time providing wide access 
possible list fairly technical how do i do 
what kind should i get kinds questions has yet
 any nonbmw bashing k bike bashing any bmw mfgd after
 piece shit bashing posts consent 
governed proscribed

 simple name change would make significant difference 
netboxerowners i am going stand way progress

so hesh let me turn question around have you has anyone
else joined list because you felt your boxer excluded
