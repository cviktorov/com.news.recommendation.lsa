 all us argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand
 technique countersteering

including all ones who think countersteer all way
through corner

well all way through decreasingradius corner anyway

 really only thing we disagree maybe we should agree 
disagree 

ok im right 

 official line here though i do have my doubts about 
front brake applied first followed rear brake idea being
 you avoid locking up rear after weight transfer takes place 

 thats official line taught those rider education classes
you were refering also dont teach countersteering i have 
question quality classes official line msf
curricula i described maximum braking achieved applying
both brakes equally when weight distribution nominally even 
both tires have equal normal forces easing off rear 
prevent locking increasing braking front more
traction available front due increased normal force due 
weight shift

 official line you have been taught seems ineffective face
 applying rear brake after front taking advantage
 all traction available rear time halving 
available braking power using only front time 

saying brake until tire just begins slide next useless
advice newbie he has go out slide tire find out
where also gives him zero information from which 
develop braking technique changes braking 
corresponding weight shift develop

 you dont slide tyre you have way knowing whether youve
achieved maximum braking im suggesting you should always
aim brake hard you possibly can you want find 
limits machine you have go beyond them 

 necessarily true chirping tire indicates impending lockup
 most surfaces serves good guide newbies indicate
maximum braking i agree totally locking front occasionally
makes one better rider manuver best saved 
experienced rider unless you have one those outrigger bikes like
code used use

 any case maximum braking i suggested you aim keep
both wheels just point sliding youll doing
exactly you suggest

true from point view how best teach riding skills
which how discussion started keep both wheels just 
point sliding nearly useless information you need teach 
technique least strategy achieve
