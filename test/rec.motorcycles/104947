i have question about tires my guzzi t tires 
were when i just bought old cracked i do have 
owners manual yet tires listed haynes manual 
front h rear h pressures recommended front 
 rear oddly pressure same tire t listed psi
instead anyone know reason i know though pressure i should run
 recommended manufacturer new tires i purchase

 real question i have old tires bike 
 front metzler touring special h rear avon
roadrunner h h marked each tire both larger
than listed haynes manual what does owners manual recommend
 common go up one size bike also my first
motorcycle innertubes any comments various manufacturers inner
tube qualities

 above sizes inches except additional mark current
rear tire what best metric match local bmw dealer thought
 h front h back he also happens 
very good getting close matching mail order prices

i am thinking going metzler me laser possibly comp k 
front me back both mbs variety possible longer 
lasting belting system i already use me both vision 
fj front like i thought shaft drive
behavior torque from guzzi me might give more predictable
back end control sliding behavior than me might well giving
much better tire milage life any comments

 friend told me he thought my bike had boranni rims which very
good relatively soft have delicate sidewalls i do wish 
mount tires myself first time so aside from warning shop 
careful any other comments i should make i havnt looked rim 
check out make yet marked he just told me late yesterday 
i havnt had chance check rim type

 another note i remove ugly good shapeanyone want 
vetter fairing i run without windscreen while eventually
i would like simple rounded cafe style quarter fairing could 
forkhandlebar mounted any suggestions thing frame
mounted quarter fairing cafe style bike how about lower
barsclipons i would like restore bike good condition
runner few modern updates while being historically exactly
accurate still have reflect relatively well representation cafe
style yes i know picky period really predates bikeit 
just bike has potential look
