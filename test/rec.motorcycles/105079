i need some advice having someone ride pillion me my ninja
 first time ive taken anyone extended ride
read farther than around block well riding some twisty 
fairly bumpy roads mines roadmthamilton loop you sf bay areans

unless she really adventurous do take her route her
first extended ride thats kinda like taking someone noshow way
speed star competition first skydive

 person lbs fairly small so i dont see weight too much
 problem what sort advice should i give her before we go
i want her hold onto me rather than grab rail out back 
ive heard she should look over my shoulder direction were
turning so she leans me what else traditional

 ninja has adjustable suspension adjust stiffer
setting so you dont bottom out bumpy curves

 tell her cardinal rules 

 never ever ever ever put her feet down when you stop stop
sign when she thinks youre gonna crash never keep them 
pegs until you tell her get off bike

b she hold onto your waist she should hold tightly enough
 she wont slide off bike you twist throttle bit 
added bonus you here she should keep close your butt 
possible so quick stops dont make her slide you knock your
balls up onto gas tank you decide how best word 

c just stay perpendicular bike straight up seat dont
lean your body curves just go bike stay perpendicular
dont look over your shoulder

 remember all times you have passenger back 
means dont pop clutch try corner stop smoother than
usual aware you jump brake youre going have
 equivalent lb dead weight crashing you from behind
so prepared 

 make sure she pisses before ride even she says she doesnt
have go antiwomen stuff here i have tiny bladder myself

 remind her look around while youre riding point things
 interest makes ride more enjoyable her she wont get
so focused just looking back your helmet gives
her ample excuse squeeze you show she saw what you pointed 

 my wife i tried msfrecommended look over riders
shoulder curves bit just didnt work timing 
her weight shift unpredictable especially maxim because
unlike ninja upright riding position really restricts 
pillions view road ahead next time i had her just remain
perpendicular bike i could hardly tell someone
else bike curves she weighs substantially over lbs
