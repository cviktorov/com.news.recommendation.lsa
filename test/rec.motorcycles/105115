molded plastic teeth ive only tried coiled nylon type 
 doesnt take much squish fix problem i found i overdoing
 broken parts zipper too hard pull so after
spreading zipper pull jaws again i tried vicegrips

 were snug zipper jaws released them tightened 
adjusting screw bit couple iterations i had just right
amount zipper squish tm
