 understanding ability swerve essentially absent among
 accidentinvolved riders hurt study
 
 average rider does identify countersteering alone
 provides primary input effect motorcycle lean themselves
 even after many years practice
 
 i would agree entirely three paragraphs did hurt
 study make any distinction between ability swerve failure
 swerve most accidents near accidents ive seen riders
 almost always stand brakes hard dare simply because
 instinct brake face danger so strong overrides
 everything else hard braking swerving tend mutually exclusive
 manouvres did hurt draw any conclusions which one generally preferable

apparently instinct brake face danger isnt strong 
 instinct freeze up do nothing face danger hurt
found surprising number accidentinvolved motorcyclists hadnt
used brakes all prior impact 

i think only way youll ever use countersteering reliably correctly 
 crisis make only conscious method directional control you
ever use practice constantly even when you have need do
any turning you follow me down long straight i seem 
wiggling back forth randomly suddenly without obvious need its because
im practicing countersteering avoiding imaginary obstacles directly 
my path all practice may indeed futile i have even
milliseconds react most familiar tactic available hopefully 
 most automatic countersteering same logic applies braking
 front brake course
