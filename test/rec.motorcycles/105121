 description pretty rowdysounding party
 
 still we wonder why stereotype us
 
 erc
 
 whacha mean weifin whom ever want stereotype me
 one likes drink beer watch lovely ladies display 
 beautiful bodies i like stereotype
 you were refering stereotype infer negative you noticed we
 didnt rape pillage burn down town we also left mucho bucks 
 money town me thinks town likes us least said so
 lynn hall nos bros
 
 
 bein themfolk who tend compose fair piece population
 bein ones regard bikers loud irresponsible irreverent
 reprobate rabble 

doesnt sound like attended though does fact we riders
need friends sounds lot like we might have whole townfull from 
lynns description especially same crowd gets invited back
 party some more year after year

 sure you didnt rape pillage its relief know you were
 gentlemen because you were completely outofhand you 
 justify your lesser indescretions some pretty distorted thinking i
 should say 

you seem one very few bent out shape over lesser
indiscretions townspeople arent ruffled 
indiscretions partyers arent either maybe indiscretions
dont amount anything more threatening damaging than harmless 
goodnatured rowdiness among consenting adults only thing 
really bothered me about description kneedeep empty beer cans 
 street maybe town had plan deal since 
helped set up party first place i lived 
bikers previous visits had established record mutual cooperation
 good intentions id certainly rather stick around party
than go riding off night impaired maybe get hurt killed

 oh im sorry i just noticed you left mucho bucks money
 nevermind my criticism i out line i forgot when one leaves
 mucho bucks money behavior permissable perhaps even 
 justified

 doesnt hurt anyone all parties party benefit
 consider entire activity benign harmless who 
needs permit justify you why do you need do 

 keep mind themfolks ones could give when 
 biker gets killed when elected officials institute further
 draconian legislation helmet laws gun controls etc ones dont 
 respect our rights roads because we do respect theirs all 
 rest time

ironically particular townsfolk probably minority 
dont happen fit stereotype you describe theyve developed 
friendly longterm mutuallybeneficial relationship group 
motorcyclists arent burdened mcignorance general
population because 

 need i continue

 need exists surely must come from within

 so continue wear your stigma badge next time you 
 whining about them effect values yours remember
 probably behavior selfrighteous wusses like myself
 kept them bay long

well you got selfrighteous wusses part right anyway
