hear screeching tires i dart my eyes my mirrors realize its 
moroon flying up right behind me my panic i pop my clutch stall 
bike luckily guy stops foot behind my rear wheel
i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind car can you
really actuality avoid incident suggestions

 experience you describe why i dont like sit my bike 
gear i figure theres chance ill startled some way 
stall my bike i figure more likely than chance 
ill unable escape some situation because extra time
needed put bike gear

so i concentrate avoiding situations rather than making splitsecond
evasive manuvers i split lanes so im end line
unfortunately legal most country i cant
split perhaps isnt room i stop near one side 
lane so i have easy escape leave my bike gear until next
car has stopped i watch my mirrors mean time make sure
 whether i really would have time move should car fail 
stop i havent had find out yet some cars have annoying habbit
 racing up behind you before braking heavilly so can hard 
tell planning brake 

so summary position yourself easy exit watch your
mirrors until its all clear
