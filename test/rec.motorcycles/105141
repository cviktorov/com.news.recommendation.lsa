 i am serious motorcycle enthusiast without motorcycle 
put bluntly sucks i really would like some advice what would
 good starter bike me i do know one thing however i need 
make my first bike good one because buying second any time soon 
out question i am specifically interested racing bikes cbr
 f gsxr i know may sound kind crazy
considering ive never had bike before i am responsible 
fast learner love 

responsible love i believe thats contradiction
 terms

unless youre really brave read reckless cc sport
bike go way faster than you dare least your first
year riding getting more than really overkill
 youll never even want use following bikes
can bought repaired cheaply easy novice
 manage plenty high performance
 kawasaki ex
 honda vf interceptor
 suzuki gse

 mph time ex full throttle way
sooner than youre ready something
 small youd probably wishing more
power pretty quickly unless its tzr rgv 

now im saying youre certain kill
yourself immediately f gsxr plenty
 people have started riding those bikes done
just fine what i am saying its waste 
money waste perfectly good plastic when you
drop thing learning how balance while stopping
youll never get throttle more than half open
anyway so why spend extra bucks
