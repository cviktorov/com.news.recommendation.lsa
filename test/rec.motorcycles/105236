he so pissed off cops pulling over speeders dangerous
spots often blind corners one day he decided get
revenge

cruising factory loaner zzr test bike he noticed cop 
had pulled over motorist off ramp almost 
shoulder being bright lad he hit his bikes kill switch
just before passing cop who happened bending towards
 offending motorist thereby exposing his glutes 
passing world

 his ignition system now dead he pumped his throtle two
 three times fill his exhaust canisters volatile raw fuel

all took stab kill switch relight ignition
 send flame sargeant swells direction

i wonder any cycle cops read cycle canada

although i agree spirit action i do hope 
 rider ponied up so takes replace exhaust system
he just destroyed owners manual explicitly warns against 
behavior exactly reason you can destroy your muflers way

one more good reason straight pipes megaphones
