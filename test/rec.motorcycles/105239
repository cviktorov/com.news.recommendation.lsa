hello folks

im very happy my new rgs my range miles gallons
thats mpg surprisingly bike real cruiser i expecting
something rough shes sweet backroad honey i can go pretty much
anyplace id take my mountain bike far shaft effect its more 
torque effect from crankshaft my opinion rev sitting still
when driveshaft moving bike twists bit maybe

 clutch large chunk counterrotating mass 
rotating hence light reving makes twist shaft effect 
rear end rising under power real problem getting lower road
when throttle snapped shut say when you cornering heads
 real close road new gs bikes paralever shaft have
almost shaft effect

i dont ride her fast enough get shaft effect my opinion
 little buffeting wind far greater consequence okay here 
my questions

 any recommendations homemade fairing id like keep 
wind off my chest perhaps my helmet comfort highway speeds
 mph yet dont want screw up stability b block my
vision too much trail riding anybody have luck twopiece 
detachible fairings id like make myself out plexiglas

 i run two lights standard headlamp plus sidelamp mounted 
crash bar illuminations excellent way full beam coming
out from level motor left side lamp beam linear so
 you get bright streak illumination from left right 
really picks up periphery deer lurking etc combined 
headlamp high you can see like day ive heard bmw alternators
dont crank out too much do i need shut down sidelamp when im
puttering around dirt low rpm 

its question how long you spend low rpm how much you need 
extra light low rpm k under dont charge all much 
 all alternators put out sufficient wattage just you need
 k rpm get 

 embarassing im having trouble starting bike first thing
 morning i invariably flood carbs go read section
 paper she starts right up zen thing 

full choke open gas taps hit starter ever so slightly blip 
throttle should fire cranking should done minimal throttle
my r likes throttles raised just bit off idle

its experience thing like zen its hard describe can hard
 learn you arent paying atttention differences between success
 failure especially you get really pissed off flatten 
battery while trying get run

 my bike has been sitting few weeks i give short while 
start doesnt i turn off wait few minutes things 
vaporize fuel system lights right off ive got dual
plugs which make easier start

 haynes manual says do under any circumstances use gasoline
 alcohol additives yeah right what do you folks due keep
 engine carbs from being eaten ethanol methanol any 
particular brands gas best additives

 big fix bing carb upgrade kit its good few mpg 
parts alcohol proof parts replaces arent alcohol proof 
long bike isnt going sit long periods time gasohol 
nice since helps keep ping away your bike doesnt ping cheap gas
you ought raise compression half smiley bmw twins 
s beyond have lowered compression keep epa happy dual plugs
 higher compression give back big chunk lost perfomance
