ive read all followups i thought id go back 
original article make specific comments about method


jaomegatestcom john oswalt said

he has obtained play play records computer readable
form every major league baseball game past several years
he devised algorithm which i call sumoversituations wrote
 computer program calculate every major league players contribution
using works like 

look every situation every game baseball season 
situation determined inning score where baserunners 
 how many outs each situation count how many
times team eventually won game situation occured 
 divide number times situation came up come up 
 value situation

 first done george lindsey late searly s 
reported

later pete palmer did same thing using simulated seasons generate
 larger set data avoid kind smallsample anomalies other
people have worried about he reported thehiddengameofbaseball
 john thorn gary skoog modified method bit did some work
 what he called value added measure based situational values
his were based directly marginal runs though win probabilities
 results applied season were reported one 
bill james baseball abstract books help me out here somebody

 example situation might inning score runner second
 outs were regular season major league games last
year rockies marlins more year
say situation came up those team ahead won
 them value situation 

description method look change win probability based bat
 plus any baserunning creditdebit player amount each time
 he gets plate appearance

now each player sum up all his atbat baserunning values
 season obtain overall value player obviously
 sum all players values each game season 
whole 

thats only because you always credit x batter x pitcher
theres validation involved

ok theres very big problem here nobody has yet commented youre
adding probabilities probabilities dont add runs you can add 
total team runs breaks down how many runs joe contributed plus how many
runs fred contributed etc probabilities dont work way bob
increases his teams chance winning each pas does
 mean bob increased his teams chance winning fact
 doesnt mean anything because units screwy

i agree disagree john saying batters efforts result
 more wins losses while you probably correct 
does mean more wins losses means something i would
rather have player who increased my teams chances winning 
each pas i would player who increased my chances winning
 each pas thus appears me obvious
positive association between johns statistic winning games thus
before you disregard stat appears me further study must
go what sort relationship 

consider example bob hits out solo hr bottom first
about your scale he does same thing again fourth 
 score tied another again seventh score
tied another finally ninth win game score
 value bob hit solo hr plate appearances 
 credited your method what does
 mean bob responsible win certainly defense
 always responsible you include pitching bob wasnt
pitching fact bob only offense which lot 
even close furthermore what about other team runs say
 all came solo hr fred fred hitting hr tie up game
which just valuable hr take lead see lindsey fred 
himself have accrued good rating so so fred bob combined have
amassed win one game theres clearly problem here

 only problem here insistance number mean exactly
how many wins team has first we using averages over many
seasons applying them one game second remember some players
performance take away from chance you winning 
player who gets out gets negative probability most cases
thus im sure any given game when you add up all numbers
 team who won add up game sometimes
 add up more one sometime less than one also
 pitchers bad performances giving up runs may have given
them large negative percentage game also any batter 
pulled night would give large negatives 



greg thinking about right things his intuition off 
mark closers enormously important total number runs
value outweighed when come prevented from comming
 doubling which greg allows enough

 another article i proposed test we can predict teams 
wonlost record quite accurately looking how many runs total 
score allow without regard when those runs score game 
late runs really more important than early runs looking only 
late runs should lead better predictor right

 really only because you have smaller sample size i would
think however number runs you score first inning
would just good prediction how many runs you score 
 last inning realize something else closer usually
comes close situation blow out hard argue
 any runs closer gives up game have equal importance
 those given up first inning look closer giving up runs
often means team lose many games other hand starter
who gives up runs often still leaves his team chance win 
offence has many more outs do something about i am 
saying all late inning situations equally important either 
i am down runs ninth really does matter how many
runs my pitcher gives up ninth 

heres another thought experiment apply method basketball what
you find points scored first half game have almost
exactly value because lead safe entire half yet play
furthermore sub off bench who sinks winning free throws 
 time clock gets game while star forward who 
scored points first half before spraining his ankle gets zero

does make sense


 why would you assume teams probability winning would
 before possesion which free throws were made look
 you down point seconds left fairly high
probability you win game you possesion 
ball do forget somebody elses missed shots turnovers
fouls bad defense etc caused negative chance team
would win
 
from reading all discussion statistic i feel those
who critisize certain extent doing so out agenda
 first look statistic valadates clutchness really
does cluthness revolves around idea certain players
 crucial situation elevate performance others performance
goes down ive never seen convincing proof really happens
so you assume clutchness means except
 lot noice statistic has positive association 
player performance way get rid noice you
do believe clutchness certainly we could find out what
 average value home run example we may find 
instance home run increases your chance winning 
 average while strikeout decreases your chance winning 
i bet were done we would find statistic just
 good other statistics we have predicting wins losses

how do we evaluate relief pitchers say john sam have 
exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs ks bbs
etc both had exceptional numbers john however only pitched
 closer situations while sam mop up man who more
valuble team probably john who better 
pitcher were probably about same
