theres lot whining about how much players overpaid i thought
id put together underpaid team could win pennant i splurged
 let four players earn much half million dollars 
highestpaid player frank thomas k i cut some players like
kenny lofton chris hoiles keith mitchell tim wakefield bunch
 pitchers all whom could have arguably made team better 
cost million lot them total team salary 
 averaging slightly over k player thats too steep
you can dump thomas bagwell replacing them paul sorrento 
 minimum wager save bit over million dollars still have one
 best teams majors
