short played scott leius who played short much his career 
before twins third mike pagliarulo jeff reboulet platoon

pags terry jorgenson platoon third reboulet 
backup infielder pags looked pretty miserable yesterday guy who
lead league da muffing what should routine grounders
heck muffing grounder i would probably have gotten jorgenson
did nothing exceptional i noticed leius missed ball i think
gagne would have reached we certainly miss gags glove season

winfield has struggled during preseason sunday against colorado 
rockies he went rbis scored once

he looked pretty good contrary what mediots have been saying
he looked reasonable first he isnt mids hrbek neither 
 pretty big guy himself any more note im used seeing twins
b looking kinda big field big he hits vaguely
like last year hes perfectly good first baseman

note much posting from personal observation yesterday game
where regulars were mostly pulled after several innings winfield may
have big holes his defensive game didnt show up he didnt have 
pick any bad throws example ill take what i saw so far
