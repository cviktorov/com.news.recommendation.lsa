javier lopez better catcher than greg olson
 has ever history baseball been yearold 
younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league
catchers terms defense brought bat wasnt 
sandy alomar who supposed good his rookie year
 wasnt benito santiago who supposed good
 his rookie year 

hrm sandy alomar year old rookie games threw
out few baserunners benito santiago year old rookie games
 he threw out few baserunners too ivan rodriguez
 year old rookies games didnt exactly suck
behind plate

i can continue thread others mentioned you get
 point you others seem so quick dismiss 
seasoned veterans favor hot young rookies perhaps 
just perhaps management team pennantwinning braves
knows something more than you do perhaps what know 
 very very few year old rookies come up majors
 make impact 

true which only makes more important realize when you have one 
few lopez season last year adjusted major league equivalencies 
 hrs how bad does he have behind plate 
 better than olsons
