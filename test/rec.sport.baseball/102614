since i havent been able keep up baseball much season i
have few questions about my favorite team minnesota twins

 how good does rotation look last i heard order 
tapani erikson mahomes banks some guy ive never heard 
sounds pretty pathetic me

well maybe banks yearold prospect who hasnt 
matured quickly would have liked mahomes yearold 
who very highly touted tapani erickson also young 
have looked very good spring last spot between jim 
deshaies formerly houston sd mike trombley deshaies 
hasnt looked very good spring so i believe spot has 
gone trombley although hadnt wanted starters unproven 
i personally believe very highly mahomes trombley


 who playing short third

well scott leius shortstop he played mostly b last year 
 ss minors moved back after gagne left kc b 
split maybe between pagliarulo who has had great spring terry 
jorgenson good looking kid who has languished portland 
years im sure how time divided seem 
happy what have here i like jorgenson i fear 
might give too much time pags
