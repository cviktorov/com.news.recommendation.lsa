 age alomar had brilliant rookie year true he limited
 injuries his sophomore season his numbers both yaer
 year following were quite mediocre season same
bill james projects ba ops 

 same bill james why do you say sounds like youre suggesting 
bill james had something do overhyping kid death au contraire
he fairly critical him after his roy campaign noting he wasnt
allworld catcher hitter he called him basically average when
everyone else media predicting next johnny bench roy
campanella 

both young men were highly touted defensive catchers
expected among best ever baseball reports i
read indicate lopez very ordinary defensively

 which reports those 

 dodgers options parrish hernandez now only carlos
piazza long he continues his very hot bat
 keep him lineup because need offensive
production when he cools off look much better defensive
catcher hernandez only play more

 i like hernandez lot piazza can catch ball youve gotta play
him imho hes much better hitter although hernandez isnt bad hitter
right now sounds like piazza catch most time hernandez
 candiottis caddy since he can catch knuckler long 
play up abilities dodgers could have very good catching
tandem 

 braves options berryhill olson i agree olson 
nothing special i do think berryhill better than many 
people rsb believe both braves catchers very
good defensively calling game blocking plate throwing
 although somewhat weak offenivsively play team
 so much need another big bat

 i think both overrated defensively see nichols law catcher
defense thats something thats difficult prove disprove from
your viewpoint mine about only tangible thing we can look 
opponents sb thats clouded how well your pitchers hold runners
catchers era possibility its subject way too many biases 

 them playing team so much need another big
bat i disagree here too about only chink braves armor 
theyre weak offensively several positions cf c b ss belliard
plays b unless bream hunter form another superplatoon very weak 
defensively blauser plays id like see braves give least one 
mel nieves javy lopez chipper jones shot much like talentrich
jays recent years theyll conservative stick what have 
im saying thats wrong just conservative
