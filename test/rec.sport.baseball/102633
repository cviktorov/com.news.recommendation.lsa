personally i think alomar all hype he producing incredibly now
 long run he never put up numbers sandberg has 
 moment alomar may best overall sandberg wins out long
shot

when sandberg alomars age he putting up seasons power
alomars oba points higher than sandbergs career high alomars
career high doubles triples higher than sandbergs sandberg 
still better than alomar only because alomar hasnt reached his full
potential yet alomars got yearheadstart sandberg he has 
hits sandberg didnt have hits until he likely 
put up better career numbers than sandberg everything except home runs
hell pass sandberg stolen bases sometime 

sandberg particulary known his stolen bases what competition did 
alomar have sandberg came year after ripken same year boggs
gwynn other magicians so less attention given sandberg 
alomar only one his class worth mediocre besides 
numbers dont count national league pitchers much better pitchers 

larry someone elses account
