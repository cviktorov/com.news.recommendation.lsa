 what jackson looked like everything converted
 neutral park basis run production his equivalent
 average started up so
 let us say he had established his last two seasons level
 play

im quite sure how numbers generated appears 
 neutral park bos hr slugging tend drop he actually loses two
home runs do what equivalent average

one thing when looking bos stats you can see kc took
away some homers normally you expect some wouldbe homers go 
doubles triples big parks caught matter you
expect lots doubles triples anyway bo despite his speed 
hit very few doubles many triples so i would expect his
value have risen quite considerably neutral park 

 good very good fact probably doesnt make top
 ten league th best eqa al dave
 winfields thomas first first nl bonds
 incroyable tenth bip roberts better
 than any season past five years joe carter about what
 mattingly had what felix jose had last two years
 just ahead time raines fiveyear average better than ryan
 kleskos mles 

felix jose has been player fairly neutral park
i would offhand guess bo around player
maybe even close

 he got more attention from media than warranted from his
 baseball playing though his hype lot better than his hitting
 basis netcomments about him being overrated 
 media would have you beleive he great hitter i think he 
 good maybe very good hitter he imo something like th best
 hitter majors

id put him about too 

note i hadnt realized media had hyped him so much i thought he
 always viewed them better football player only soso 
 baseball he did only have one hr rbi season kc wasnt
winning

note i maybe have harped bit past 
mistake being made sdcns known group
 respect players like bo deion lofton perhaps others

we find you look large group players past major
 minor league numbers predict future numbers fairly well
 some caveats younger less good prediction
 lower minor league less good i imagine more recent
 player has left college ball etc

now course prediction involves quite bit error sometimes
 player poor mles dave justice ventura becomes star
some hitters develop shane mack brian downing some dont oddibe
mcdowell mickey brantley error involves real things 
real reasons why oddibe didnt hit shane did may who knows
involve parks batting coaches wheaties injuries lifting
 so 

 still you have big pool players things work pretty well
one reasons predictions accuracy common background
 players one thing we know about professional baseball players 
 all them almost all have spent good deal time playing
ball backgrounds similar

what hasnt been established what happens when you encounter player
 different background some reason believe 
bo deion lofton tony gwynn ainge so
 has different background standard model standard
assumptions fit person slowly

 hasnt been established you can use mles twosport players
 hasnt been established you cant statistics after
all art i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about bo deion lofton
look those goodbutnotgreat minor league numbers say well
what happens those numbers simply dont mean what usually mean
 might mean ken lofton suddenly has better year houston than
tuscon might mean deion suddenly has better halfyear 
atlanta than greenville 

 again might ken deion might go right back tank
 year live up those poor mles you guys dont know whats 
worse you dont know you dont you dont know 
other players you wont know about injuries lifting wheaties 
again you seem think model perfect eternal its 
its got some error

oh well
