well perhaps braves had one else worth playing year 
would lopez do have others worth playing 
least opinion 

catcher weakest position possible exception second base
 have chance simultaneously replace biggest offensive problem
spot wellaboveaverage offensive player acclimate highly
promising potential star pressure him carry team 
want play olson berryhill instead

i disagree i dont think tangible skill any more than
leadership i dont deny real skill some catchers
may much better than others i really dont see any way we
could ever know who nicholss law catcher defense eerily
accurate far too often me take defensive assessments catchers very
seriously

sorry new dont know nichols law 

 catchers defensive reputation inversely proportional his
 recent offensive level performance thus mickey tettleton goes 
 media from being nohit defensive whiz slugging thumbfinger
 two short years rule doesnt apply perceived superstars who
 get gold glove offensive transfer effect instead greg olson probably
 considered good defensive catcher precisely because he cant hit


dont believe catchers
era i am interested pitchers eras different catchers

arent same thing

 other words we know more than do so only logic behind 
 different decision than we would make must financial 

either just stupidity

i presume
we feel way about other franchises than atlanta 

 course

 fair young players does make organizational sense 
i think does

well does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them
 decisions i mean please dont tell me how run my
business especially when im being successful

one could make same sort argument other cases pete rose 
pursuing ty cobbs record huge gate attraction national media
magnet reds made lot money off also wasted prime
 eric davis may good business doesnt mean i dont
loathe them 



 
 david m tate i do know what about you closes
 posing opens only something me understands
 e e can pocket your glove deeper than pete roses
 dy cummings nobody even tim raines has soft hands
