 stay school you have lot learn
 
 learn what i know million dollars lot money i 
know 
 rickey henderson doesnt have career out baseball i know 
he 
 didnt have baseball he wouldnt making near money he 
now
 

 michael jackson jack nicholson bill cosby wouldnt 
making near much money werent entertainers so whats
your point

 i just dont understand how some athlete who only plays sport 
 
 living millions dollars say he being paid enough
 
 nobody sign him his asking price he one 
hurting
 still win without him

 you cant usually take away one teams best
players still expect them win do you think 
pirates continue win without barry bonds

 
 remeber many athletes have nothing 
athletic 
 ability nothing getting paid much more than most hard 
working
 citizens complaining enough pay

so again jack nicholson gets paid much more than most hard
working citizens much more than rickey henderson 
matter 

 
 i dont have problem them making millions my problem 
when 
 say arent being paid enough when already get 
millionalso
 numbers get worse

 reason latter often happens many folks
start making real big salaries late career when 
 decline exceptions course dave parker
fell apart after making his first million because he put most
 million up his nose
