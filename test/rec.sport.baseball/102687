 argh here where you obviously dead wrong since yankees 
 s s has team been so nicely setup yearsand years 
 come braves i dont think allstar team able beat 

 may appropriate comparison
 yankees finshed nd rd nd finshing 
 games out first 
 also finished second though were only
 games out
even great teams can lose thats why play season
 other hand im still picking braves go all way


um surely you didnt intend compare reds 
 philidelphia yankees were finishing nd 
 team good yankees while 
yankees had aged some from peak years ruth gehrig
couldnt play every position simultaneously

imo given various ages braves reds season
 braves closer peak while reds
have slightly passed peak

also youre going compare braves yankees more appropriate
comparison braves might yankees 
after falling short two years row exciting world series
 both teams wonwill win series year despite 
heroics some old fart other team
