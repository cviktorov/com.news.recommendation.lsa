since i one responsible divergent threads 
approx posts going back braves could better off
 injury happens i may well inject little more
fuel flame

 back beginning spring training i though
lopez would make squad easily olson still
recovering from his lateseason injury knee i believe
 were questions whether he would 
able play before june berryhill dinged up

i looking forward because i believe lopez
can hit field position before last season he 
 braves defensive catcher prospect while brian deak 
 braves offensive catcher prospect besides olson
 berryhill couldnt hit way out wet cardboard
box dont walk enough useful

 olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered braves went
 two vets i still say one those two had been down
 start season he wouldnt have gotten his job back

 certain logic keeping olson berryhill around
after all ml catchers short supply suffer from wear 
tear teams out without one average ml catcher
california seattle come mind certainly trying 
move olson berryhill through waivers would unlikely work
plus youd have eat salary which isnt huge isnt
tiddleywinks either i think olsons about berryhill
 thats only what i recall

 yes i think arbitrationeligibility may have role 
play also what year players
arent eligible arbitration only were roster
 longest eligible course system may change
 extent change yet known from business
standpoint may make sense keep lopez down until junethe
first time olsonberryhill go dl

 i am still disappointed lopez isnt team
i still prefer think myself fan when comes braves
 truth id rather see our best team field
which imo includes lopez

 coursetoday we play cubs hopefully we wont need him 

 schuerholzcox conversation i imagine went
like remember theyve both been gms
 following meant read humorimpaired

cox ok weve sent jones down his fielding could 
little smoother besides blauser can hit ok his fielding
 better than used 

schuerholz well well have send nieves down too deion
just wont sign baseball only contract we cant count
 him october so we have keep nixon around 
defense besides gormans ready give up 
billy hatcher yet once hatchers gone deion signs
we can move nixon frankie rodriguez ought 
give us some pitching depth 

cox yep thatll nice too bad deion wont sign

day dl mwahahahaha

schuerholz what about caraballo

cox well hes much better than lemke maybe he starts
 richmond hell start walking more besides hes going 
arbitrationeligible better stretch him out so we actually
get some value from him before he makes big bucks

schuerholz now lets see leaves lopez

cox nooooo i gotta keep lopez sure i didnt think olson
would recover quickly maybe i can talk caminiti 
running him again

schuerholz nope lopez has gotta go you know hell get
 million arbitration may well put off one
extra year besides until olsons shown his stuff little
bit i cant trade him besides berryhills lefthanded
