 argh here where you obviously dead wrong since yankees 
 s s has team been so nicely setup yearsand 
 years come braves i dont think allstar team able 
 may appropriate comparison
 yankees finshed nd rd nd finshing 
 games out first 
 also finished second though were only
 games out
 even great teams can lose thats why play season
 other hand im still picking braves go all way

 um surely you didnt intend compare reds 
 philidelphia yankees were finishing nd 
 team good yankees while 
 yankees had aged some from peak years ruth gehrig
 couldnt play every position simultaneously
 
 imo given various ages braves reds season
 braves closer peak while reds
 have slightly passed peak
 
 also youre going compare braves yankees more appropriate
 comparison braves might yankees 
 after falling short two years row exciting world series
 both teams wonwill win series year despite 
 heroics some old fart other team 
 casey stengel dave winfield

perhaps so i only responding yankees s s 
part comment those teams were sure thing lost 
 its probably so unreasonable someone pick another 
team i did
