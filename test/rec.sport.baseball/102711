we know very very few players age make much impact
 bigs especially when havent even played aaa ball 

yes irrelevant youre talking about averages when we
have lots information about player particular base our
decisions 

do you really have much information him really

i dont personally clay just posted yes we do 

unfortunately shows lopez wasnt good example nieves would
have been since his last year numbers were out line previous
years which i didnt have access 

 point remains though knowing guys minor league history good
 knowing his major league history you know how read 

why isnt lopez likely hit well he hit well last year after
adjusting his stats park league he hit better 
absolute scale than olson berryhill did lot

i dont know you tell me what percentage players reach 
exceed mles rookie season were talking about
 you know

 mle projection its equivalence its how
well he hit last year major league terms rating so essence he
has already reached i would guess bob clay essentially half
 all players surpass previous mles rookie seasons maybe
more than half since all players young improving

 were your purpose maybe offerman spent getting 
acclimated you dodgers team paid big price
 season 

did offerman may have been difference between th th place
 last place more

perhaps reap benefits down road
do you really think would have done what did 
were competing pennant

sure didnt have anyone better i suppose might have gutted 
farm system acquire jay bell spike owen somebody were really
 contention 

 point ab significant sample rather he
hadnt done anything spring training cause even blockhead manager
 question whether his minor league numbers were real send him
down until he gets warmed up

 stathead im amazed you put any credence spring
training 

 youd read what i wrote youd less amazed nowhere do i claim put
any credence spring training quite contrary i said lopez hadnt
done anything even bozos who do put credence spring training
could interpret failure just because i think spring training numbers
 meaningless doesnt mean bobby cox does its just case ruling
out one possible explanation sending lopez down

 kid improve playing aaa 

just like keith mitchell did

wait minute i missed something here 

keith mitchell did very very well aa aaa majors over season
 did very very poorly year aaa
