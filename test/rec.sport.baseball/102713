most discussion has been between mark singer david tate
 valentine weighing same side dave various times
my opinion fwiw all

mark age doesnt matter ability does i would rather have untried
rookie great minor league numbers than veteran who has proven
himself average best i dont care he he plays
better than what i have i want him out sandy alomar had decent
minor league numbers grossly inflated pcl general las
vegas particular he should have been projected average major
league hitter which good catcher ill admit santiagos
numbers would probably come out same sandys i dont have
 league data from mids check out

 being said i agree sending lopez richmond least 
start season box below shows he has one minor league
season which he hit well he has two which he hit very very
poorly i want see lopez real olson berryhill
 complete mediocrities catchers especially nl catchers
 essentially average hitters equivalent averages around
 he had hit well prior levels i would say he belongs 
 braves reasonable chance lopez last year 
just much fluke alomar santiago one year 
any level any age doesnt satisfy my standards evidence

 similar note i dont understand why more people 
supportive neon deion granted i thought his behavior 
mccarver last year completely bush last year first time
he ever got ab one place so his lines hard read he
has combined ops minor league play his speed more
valuable than ops alone indicates still young age 
had monster year ops he has total major minor
eqa above major league average above average cf
which about nl last year he has shown least 
potential going s which would make him one 
best hitters league he has two full seasons before reaching
his prime season he should considered legitimate
prospect simple sideshow attraction
