every single piece evidence we can find points major league baseball
being offense defense run scored just important run
prevented 

 certainly passes common sense test me any
 statistical evidence say what percent defense pitching what
 percent fielding id really like know btw sherri thanks 
 da data i find fascinating

 course run scored just important run prevented
just penny saved penny earned enough cliches
my point braves starters able live up 
 potential wont need much offensive support
i realize big staff leaves bosox dust
 legitimate comparison two cy young winners three other
pitchers most any team league would kill have first
 second starter seems me when quality pitchers take 
mound other teams score less runs team scores most 
runs wins puts team better pitching advantage
providing can stop opposing team from scoring runs low 
scoring game would clearly benefit braves should have many 
low scoring games due excellent pitching below average hitting
 flip side you had starting lineup great offensive players
i would arguing team would need great pitchers
 would have advantage because could simply outscore 
opponent name games win even ray knight knows 
you do putting more runs up scoreboard
all im trying say you assemble quality pitchers
like braves have offense doesnt need strong
