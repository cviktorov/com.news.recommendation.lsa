oops i came across file from last year thought you might
enjoy some thoughts predictions were made 
date indicated largely out order



june 
tedwardcscornelledu me
what have i done i computed expected winning percentage 
each team from obp total bases runs allowed i use 
basic rc formula pythagorean projection i compare 
 actual winning percentage all stats through june 

team obp tb ra w l xwp diff
baltimore 
boston 
toronto 
new york 
milwaukee 
detroit 
cleveland 

minnesota 
oakland 
texas 
chicago 
california 
kansas city 
seattle 

you all know how things turned out orioles red sox yankees
all disappeared jays tigers continued essentially 
expected pace brewers indians cranked second half

 rangers predictably took dive shouldnt have surprised
anybody meanwhile predicted mariners dropped behind 
angels royals clearly didnt deserve record 
june white sox upped game bit while twins
dropped off little most part things were expected

okay so were few blatant errors predictive
calculation i thought did pretty well

 braves insert kent mercker starting rotation
sometime year bielecki traded released lei
brandt becomes fifth starter best bullpen baseball
has pena berenguer stanton wohlers freeman pete smith who
spotstarts well

hm pete smith made rotation instead mercker bielecki
wasnt released until end year i wont comment 
bullpen jeff reardon 

 blauser wins starting shortstop job outright end
 may bream goes dl klesko goes nice hitting
honeymoon la gregg jefferies platooning hunter
mitchell wins center field job bit later allstar break 
nixon stays valuable pinchrunner lonnie released unless
 braves find taker trade

right blauser wrong bream mitchell bit early 
lonnie bielecki didnt pick sanders did anybody 

 managers fired year chronological order
fregosi showalter valentine riddoch

three them went right showalter still around likely 
stick seems



from mattelautotrolcommattelautotrolcom tue mar

 my response

from tedward tue mar 

hmph can tell you mets fan do you mind i make some counter
predictions against yours follow
 mets come third behind pittsburgh montreal

okay so mets finished fifth i got pirates expos
right

 yankees offense pitching flounders dropping them fourth
 place al east boston wins games division pennant

 me

 dwight gooden rushes his comeback gets blown out goes dl from
 may through midjuly
 saberhagen runs record wfan criticizes mets giving away
 great talent jefferies who has solid year kc

do you care put your prediction down posterity you predict
mark grace get rbis i say you out your mind 
 almost impossible hr type guy batting behind dawson who
kills most rallies he doesnt finish

why do you say mark has driven 
last year mark batting second primarily his worse year
average wise since he batting either rd th year i predict 
he back up his previous standards i think he better
 rbis much stretch

sometimes us statheads get lucky grace didnt hit behind dawson
 entire season he also finished only rbis



from nssmidwayuchicagoedu tue may 

 most ballsy prediction ever

mark mcgwire hit more hrs year

nope he slowed down injury finished him off didnt
even reach ballsy prediction nonetheless



from ecaxronmarslercnasagov thu may 
 baltimore fade win division year
 finish within five games i find prospect two
 orioles winning each easier comprehend than two sox
 offense i think pitching about good division
 has offer

 orioles finished seven games out none them won though
mussina might have had chance better relief more starts

 nobody else division worth darn all finish minimum
 fifteen games out tribe thats another reason watch
 baltimore year next wont waste many those games 
 against rest division

except brewers who you probably forgot you were right 
rest division thoroughly mediocre yankees indians
led wins red sox trailed wins none were
horrible four were five more games below

date thu aug gmt

right me i never said jays were cinch clinch 
 i said milwaukee more threat than baltimore i
do think toronto should win after i dont consider
anything cinch unless you have something like game lead 
games go i do think jays have best talented team 
 al east we had good even average manager we might
have bigger lead right now i also think orioles 
play much better than baseball rest season

you win



from kingcogsciucsdedu thu nov 

 article novcscornelledu you write
 indiansthe first only season ever 

prediction cleveland indians win more games next year

you were right



from stvjasmeteorwiscedu fri sep 

 jose rijo win cy young award he healthy enough go
 least ip who would have thought he would try steal base why
risk injury

he had ip didnt win cy young maddux surprised all

 orioles win games least next years
probably last pitching staff have team era
among best al least next years 
necessarily all same years win one take 
long time verify

i dont think i want wait long won games last
year were fifth league era bad start

 ben mcdonald challenge era title next 
years nor he have victories either year challenge i
mean finish among leaders being among leaders before 
season done doesnt count he probably never pitcher
he hyped still decent starter have

looks like he wasnt bad last year just too consistent 
ace so far year looks like more same

 phillies give up many fewer walks ifwhen get rid 
bullpen coach ryan i am predicting when whether get rid
 him you have give team little bit time adjust 
before seeing radical change would have fine pitching staff 
 would just steal ray miller away from pittsburg white sox seem 
have same problem bad

i honestly cant say did get rid him bb totals were
down last year

 ricky jordan have rbi he starts games hitting 
 spot any lineup spot lineup very
good obp hitters applies each next 
years

i just dont think hes good

 billy ripken never again hit over ab

 so far so good im definitely waiting check one



from panixspiracmclnyuedu fri sep 

 matter what lou gorman his scouts say paul quantrill 
never ever adequate major league starter never i have never
seen starting pitcher who can only strike out per innings aaa
 successful majors

current plans seem use quantrill long relief he has 
rubber arm unusual delivery he might decent role

belle hit hr last year walking times five those were
intentional okay so i exaggerate i might have been right

 os going sign cal elis wallet welded shut outgoing 
 money only wide open incoming cash 

my prediction which you may make note valentine eli jacobs
 defer any serious negotiations cal ripkens contract until 
season over eli give cal every opportunity have his stats tumble
 bit from last years pace before coming forth offer

despite claims opcy designed cals strength my feeling 
 foot leftcenter canyon cut down cals power stats

after all its hard credibly offer millionyear 
allstar game mvpal mvpgold glove shortstopbaseball deity 
 itd lot easier offer similar salary obviously
declining above average shortstop who had career year one full
season ago

 course cal does match his numbers eli going faced
 rather huge expensive problem

how much did cal sign when did he sign i remember
correctly he got rather hefty contract despite weak season



 finally

from jpalmeruwovaxuwoca thu sep 

generally because expansion lot 
mediocre talent hanging around much make 
expansion teams look younger talent around which build
