keeping line pessimists net ill hold off astros
being all way back could indeed contend would count 
 atlanta encountering some unforeseen problems injuries keeping
 up early season abysmal hitting

 while atlanta has undisputed best starting rotation i feel 
relief staff may suspect dont have real closer although
mike stanton saves has been used role didnt stanton start off
great last year falter despite your point well taken
atlanta doesnt seem have same personality ny team thus 
unlikely selfdestruct houston take em atlanta needs 
suffer some injuries particularly starting rotation


 astros relief corps holding together doug jones keeps his changeup
 effective xavier hernandez can effective its passable
 theres reasonable lefthanded help middle relief iffy
 tom edens expected take over joe boever setup man role 
 hes been injured he expansion team acquisition anyway 
 houston thought boever would demand too much money so let him
 go doug jones can lose his touch he went from clevelands allstar
 closer minors pretty short span

 from what i understand boever murphy were considered expendable 
club houston felt positions could filled number 
players art doug jones key houstons success he must have
another great year houston challenge nl west 

lousey spring
 closer minors pretty short span


 right strong rotation take pressure off troubling
 bullpen


 bit shakiness fifth starter slot thats basically normal
 taubensee anthony gonzalez cedeno fulfilling some hitting potential
 anthony appears about taubensees swing looks lot better
 year solid knock against expos last night gonzalez showing 
 some early power cedeno still has loopiest swing side 
 tim wallach

 unsuspected strength lower part order has saved 
 club so far biggio finley just arent doing job getting
 base instead filling his role rbi man bagwell has had 
 assume biggio finleys job biggio concerns me since he usually
 starts season very strong


 

 side note you all concerned rumors concerning
next years uniform talk road uniform 
blech traditional grey word houston written across 
chest im mistaken home uniforms may totally eliminate
 color orange shiver mclanes favorite color red so
 im really upset current unforms dull new ones sound
horrible id like see uniform mids return 
may have been pretty houston had established long precident 
wearing ugliest uniforms baseball i liked 

end bargain remember two years ago little relief goes long way
 could win games i doubt ill project them wins
