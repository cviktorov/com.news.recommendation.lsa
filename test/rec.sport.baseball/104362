 lee smith ha why dont we give dave kingman chance darrell

evans yeah yeah after hall fame takes them can take 
eddie

murray jeff reardon

 well any case i am sick tired mostly sick everybody
giving

hall fame consideration players todays standards
marginal

honestly ozzie smith robin yount dont belong theyre both

shortstops just hung around long time big deal

 lets little more selective huh stop handing out honors
so

liberally save them guys who really deserve face 
something

isnt done little prestige hall fame anymore when

certain individuals believe steve garvey jack morris potential

candidates absurdity apparent gee can guys even compare 

 more likely future hall famers like kirby puckett nolan ryan

around years continue post great stats why shouldnt dave kingman
get hall murray evens reardon others what hell do
