 joe torre has worst manager baseball
 
 anyone who didnt see sundays game
 
 right hander pitching he decides bench lankform left handed
 hitter play jordan gilkey both right handers
 
 thats because lankford had minor injury from couple games
before 
 daytoday only available pinchrunner 

 
 later ninth inning bases loaded two outs he puts
 lankford hitter power pinch runner uses luis
 alicea hitter power pinch hitter what hell
 he thinking

 see above
 
 earlier game interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented
 how fortunate cardinals were get whiten whiten would 
 regular even though meant gilkey would hurt torre said
 he liked gilkey coming off bench gilkey hit over last year
 what does he have do start guy would starting most every
 team league
 
 beginning interview torre also said lankford 
one outfield
 guy whos matter what
 my guess jordan eventually end up being odd man out due low
 base percentage whiten great acquisition decent offense
 great defense rightfield dont worry gilkey 
starting 
 soon jordan whiten displays extended period low offensive
