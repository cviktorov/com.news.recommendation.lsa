some pleasant some so pleasant surprises about 
edition bronx bombers so far

first pleasant

spike owen all through spring training guy 
 looking like second coming mike gallego 
 even worse hitting now guy third major leagues
 ba hes ranked pretty high total hits runs
 scored i know its still early season he 
 pat kelly more him minute have provided lot 
 spark bottom order thats given big guys
 mattingly tartabull oneill plenty rbi opportunities
 lets hope he keeps up

pat kelly guy finally showing some ability
 led stick michael label him star s
 i wouldnt go far kelly looks infinitely improved
 bat i guess tips he took from boggs spring training
 really paid off huh here i thought boggs would never
 do anything help anybody besides himself his glove
 like always has been terrific he mattingly comprise 
 best defensive right side infield all baseball imho

paul oneill we had get rid roberto kelly partly 
 because he under too much pressure ny next
 barry bonds he wont do cincy either partly
 because he had real unprofessional tendency give up
 second half year i just felt we couldve
 gotten more him than oneill well so far oneill 
 turning out just fine he looks like he should able 
 duplicate surpass mel halls numbers from last year
 he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around tartabull
 now only buck would play him against lefties some more 
 see what he can do

wickman friend made comparison between wickman jack
 morris never have impressive stats always
 find some way win although morris seems losing 
 ability i figured wickman would least important
 part steve sax trade best trade since we got ruth
 guy maybe winding up good middle reliever i like what
 ive seen so far he doesnt pitch pretty he gets job done

key whats going here key just supposed provide
 rotation some stability you know shore up left
 side provide experience get maybe wins here guy
 dominating everybody he faces who needs maddux cone 
 ill take key any day

 now so pleasant surprises

spike owen sure hes hitting like crazy guy cannot
 field save his life said he brought 
 provide defense velarde stankiewicz even silvestri
 better defensively than owen

 remember its still early look his offense tail off his
defense improve hopefully he has rep because i heard either
last year over last years something like he has third
highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops behind cr 
tony im gonna help sorry mets team all fernandez i do agree
though he has looked all impressive field thus far

tartabull book tartabull keep him healthy 
 hell produce well he hasnt done too much so far sure hes
 hit few homers those were all solo shots he hasnt
 gotten any big rbis your cleanup man supposed
 give you again he had slow start last year once he
 got off dl turned oneman wrecking crew
 late year so well see

 bullpen ughwhat happened we were supposed have
 one most solid pens majors meanwhile pen
 has already blown three saves maybe more i havent checked
 great howefarr leftyrighty tandem farrs era 
 s s howes isinfinite i didnt think 
 thing possible hopefully theyll get 
 acts together else bucks gonna burn out starters
 fear bullpenll blow lead

 immortal words scooter holy cow seaver johnny key
