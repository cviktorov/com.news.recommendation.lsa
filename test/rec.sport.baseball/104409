 over necessary thanks mr hernandez who posts daily

 i do service entire baseball world usenet especially
 those east coast who cant get final scores west coast games
 newspapers late tv newscasts helpful fans other
 countries who either receive only weekly scores updates week also
 many have requested kind service previously only

i dont personally use im sure others do my point 
postingthere need individuals duplicate ad hoc fashion
what you have already organized
 
 you want send updates scores set up private mailing list
