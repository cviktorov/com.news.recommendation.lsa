one also has separate offense batting baserunning 
split probably somewhere around 

 id give baserunning little more credit than maybe 
 even give team roberto alomar team john oleruds
 identical batting stats which wouldnt unreasonable 
 even you dont let roberto steal single base theyll score lot
 more than oleruds going firsttothird more often offense
 gordon

i wouldnt give baserunning much value

 above effect clear other effects well 
olerud hits double any runner first score alomar legs 
extra base onto hit gap runner first may need hold
 third thus oleruds doubles have more advancement value than
alomars course alomar more likely score after hitting 
double

another reason give too much extra value baserunning 
 runs created formulas work very fast very slow teams 
team s ran much some teams certainly had faster players
than others still current runs created formulas work just well
 s all teams 

bill james gives senators example used harmon
killebrew regularly pinch runner stole bases 
 times caught stealing yet scored slightly more runs than
predicted runs created
