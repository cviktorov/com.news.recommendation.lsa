 well officially its braves least up until started winning
 still officially 
 so why how did receive label
 
 unoffically without doubt americas team cubs why
 well my guess because america loves underdogs every year matter
 cubs talent predictions never close never 
 possible win anything over years losing has mounted america
 has fallen love perennial losers cubs have more fans
 chicago some teams do worldwide cubs have more fans 
 worldwide than most teams division combined 
 aura excitement surrounds cubs beginning season
 like one else including ws champs must eternal hope
 year theyve got talent theyre off good start
 theyve got pitching hitting whatever strong point 
 time its inevitability cubs eventually 
 win ws again when only god knows since its been so long 
 could come any time could another years until 
 do finally win start winning consistently cubs remain
 americas lovable underdogs cubs areamericas team

 defenition underdog team has talent comes
out nowhere contend mets orioles prime examples
 cubs i root cubs because i feel sorry them 
basically dogs pirates today great example underdog
 rockies marlins compete underdogs north stars
trip stanley cup finals good example underdogs journey 
 cubs have good team year play weak division much
less than americas team
