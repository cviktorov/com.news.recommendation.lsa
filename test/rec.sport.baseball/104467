 has jack lost bit his edge what worst start jack morris has had
 
 uh jack lost his edge about years ago has had only one above
 average year last 
 
 again goes prove better good than lucky you can
 count good tomorrow lucky seems prone bad starts 
 bad finish last year 
 
 yes i am enjoying every last run he gives up who who said
 morris better signing than viola
 
 hey valentine i dont see boston any world series rings 
 fingers

oooooo cheap shot 

 damn morris now has three probably hall fame his 
 future

who cares he had two them before he came toronto 
jays had signed viola instead morris would have been frank who
won got ring he would his way year too

 therefore i would have say toronto easily made best 
 signing

your logic curious spurious

 reason believe viola wouldnt have won many games
had he signed toronto when you compare stupid wl records
 sure compare teams offensive averages too


now looking anything like morrisviola sweepstakes year later
 basically hindsight were plenty reasons why 
should have been apparent viola better pitcher based
 previous recent years also based age frank almost 
years younger how many knew people got caught up 
world series morris wins last year wins stupidest
most misleading statistic baseball far worse than rbi r he
won just means jays got him lot runs

 only really valid retort valentine werent red sox trying
 get morris too oh sure said viola first choice
afterwards what should we have expected would say

 dont tell me boston win year wont 
 even top division more like th

 true wont lack contribution viola so who cares
