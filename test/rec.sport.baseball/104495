so far simmons looks like total idiot

whatever you say i think its just games season myself so
im going wait bit before calling names

 i am sure simmons ready say i told you so after otto had 
impressive win last week now ottos latest debacle has restored simmons
reputation now he looks like he back his form when he had 
als highest era among starters four our sakenot teds sake i hope he
pitches era rest season yeah right

i expect dave otto really bad pitcher i have 
idea why simmons ever wanted him other hand i expect him 
release otto he doesnt turn things around pretty fast btw
ottos game score ip stinker only which points out
 problem method since ottos performance infinitely bad
 excruciatingly prolonged

 tomlin merced bit disappointing still doing decently
 considering considerable amount talent maturity have
shown first seasons seem have actually gotten little
bit worse 

i think merceds rookie year bit flukey arent you willing 
give him some more bats tomlin few more starts before acting
so gloomy

 walk well he seems losing end tonight i still think 
 walk desrved his contract

 he didnt walk time bomb he has stuff whatsoever when
 league finally realizes wont pretty all

 rookie batters well young has surprised me bit his
instant impact other than excellent performance hasnt
been too much surprise i think we should thank doughty 

dont so fast doughty guy who signed steve buechele which
 move threatened bury kevin young minors
meanwhile im sure whether doughty simmons signed martin 
sixyear free agent before season

 rookie pitchers worse than expected especially cooke

twice through rotation youve given up yikes

 slaught how come he wasnt given contract extension last year 
now his value has increased immensely

 so has his age least baseball terms useful halflife
 yearold injuryprone catcher cant much longer than year

 lonnie smith well eric davis signed comparable amount

 he wanted dodger felt he had something prove after his
disastrous i dont think any chance bucs sign
him

lets see eric can hit better he can run better he can field better
now why didnt pirates go after eric davis injured davis better
than healthy lonnie smith 

he certainly wasnt last year

even lonnnie smith gets some big hits yearhe wont asset 
he has looked terrible bases field

hey thats skates smith package deal anybody who acquires
lonnie his defense baserunning particularly stage 
 real weirdo

 management big big zero sauer has yet make forceful argument
 favor revenue sharing he seems more concerned about pleasing 
idiot danforth preparing team move tampa bay

 thats goal team ownership than i dont see why sauer
gets zero making his boss happy i dont know what he has 
hasnt said about revenue sharing so i cant comment 

 alex cole fiasco 
 stuff deleted
ironically biggest accomplishment simmons tenure 
getting alex cole really cheap too bad he gave him away 
expansion draft

its annoying since leyland seems have been pushing them
 retain jeff king probably unavoidable meanwhile i think
bigger accomplishments simmons tenure were getting some value 
john smiley trading real prospects veterans down stretch
last year drafting well letting rookies show something
 foley smith candelaria were acquired replacement
parts which means even fail hasnt done serious damage 
 bucs future

 compensatory draft picks bonds forget pirates can rant 
 rave get those picks now issue still 
being appealed

does mean bucs lost initial arbitration case i
never heard outcome when final verdict 


now doesnt convince anyone simmons sauer idiots
nothing else 

im sure who idiot case so i dont know who 
blame might have been doug danforth after all fact i
seriously suspect doug danforth who has shown his
willingness call shots exactly those moments when gun 
pointed his feet

btwive wondered whether my latest posts have been getting
offsite so somebody known impersonate ee cummings can see
 would he drop me short note
