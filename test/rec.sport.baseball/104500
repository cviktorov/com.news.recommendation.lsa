spike owen sure hes hitting like crazy guy cannot
 field save his life said he brought 
 provide defense velarde stankiewicz even silvestri
 better defensively than owen

remember its still early look his offense tail off 
his defense improve hopefully he has rep because i heard
 either last year over last years something like
 he has third highest fielding percentage among major league
shortstops behind cr tony im gonna help sorry mets
team all fernandez i do agree though he has looked all
 impressive field thus far

owen only has one error so far i believe seriously
underrepresents harm he has done field

owen cleanly play any ball he reaches he have fine
fielding percentage like always problem he doesnt
reach anything isnt hit straight him

 wouldnt quite obvious problem he were playing next 
kelly gruber robin ventura third baseman yankees
 wade boggs who should have moved across diamond last year

ive only seen one game abbotts first start were three
balls hit left side which would have been stopped quality
defensive players instead were charged hits against abbott

cheers
