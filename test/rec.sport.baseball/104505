dave winfields name does go
 same sentence aaron robinson ott 



 terms peak i repeat peak years winfield has done 
all he has batted s season drove more runs 
many times row before his injury consistently hit near 
while knocking home runs have you even looked dave winfields 
slugging percentage three his best seasons i still think 
dave one better all time obviously best he 
one best athletes evr play baseball he hit line drives hit 
 scoreboard leftcenter field feat np one has done new 
stadium heck only other people have hit over green fence 
since has been remodeled he could field had bullet arm his 
hitting comparable many seasons gary sheffields barry bonds 
 last season he older now slowing down takes more 
uppercut lift ball out park he always my hero 
 my idol nothing could make me happier than george 
inviting dave back bronx play his last year ball 
yankees course he most likely refuse offer who knows 
 million dollars hell play heck giving gallego 
million year having dave dh while leaving him time play 
 field when tartabull injured nokes mass traded should 
give yanks inspiration leadership sweep new age 
 yankee domination
