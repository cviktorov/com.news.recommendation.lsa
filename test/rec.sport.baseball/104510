 hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves 
i mean heck dave winfield hohum seriously being considered 
 lee smith ha why dont we give dave kingman chance darrell
evans yeah yeah after hall fame takes them can take 
eddie murray jeff reardon

oh yeah dave winfieldmarginal player guy didnt hit lick had
negligible power crap fielder had staying power dave winfield
now entering his i believe th big league season still damn decent
hitter admittedly his defense has slipped great deal his prime
he had powerful arm great range take look stats i dont 
know where you even begin make argument winfield kingman 
similar players kingman onedimension power hitterhe couldnt field
he ran like anvil hit low average though i remember right his
obp wasnt hideous those who consider things important
 absoluteprimodick 
eddie murray yup only best st baseman s i know 
mvp votes conducted mediots given he got jobbed out 
mvp he deserved seems he wasnt overrated media 
lee smith hmmmm ones actually pretty close hes had s
solid dependable career closer despite pitching some nasty parks 
wrigley fenway id have take closer look stats its been 
 while seems lee arthur hof caliber 
you do make legitimate point about hof credentials relievers
simply racking up lot saves doesnt mean whole hell lot you 
blow bunch too simply because minnesota boston month
atlanta used reardon closer longer than he should have been one 
 equalizer has racked up impressive number saves way should 
homerman hof imho
darrell evans nice career actually bit underrated kinda like
ted simmons imho hofer

 well any case i am sick tired mostly sick everybody
giving hall fame consideration players todays standards
marginal

lemme ask you who hell playing game isnt marginal

honestly ozzie smith robin yount dont belong theyre both
shortstops just hung around long time big deal
lets little more selective huh stop handing out honors so
liberally save them guys who really deserve face something

now wait goddamn minute here ozzie smith absolutely redefined 
position shortstop his defense so good hes won something along
 lines gold gloves again gold gloves mediotbiased 
good argument could made larkin deserved one two ozzies more
recent awards usually tempered someone else early
s getting gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier his career ozzies
offense you ask good obp great speed numbers park which most his
career depressed offense admittedly power cept against tom niedenfuer
 still definite asset offensively
yount hits mvp two different positions uhhuh real
stiff his one great years ever player recent memory
 probably ranks behind only peak seasons wagner banks far 
ss numbers go hes clear hofer imho

isnt done little prestige hall fame anymore when 
certain individuals believe steve garvey jack morris potential 
candidates absurdity apparent gee can guys even compare 
 more likely future hall famers like kirby puckett nolan ryan

well far garvey goes youre right garvey mediot 
candidate pushed because his winning attitude minor factor one
 all his great defense errors admittedly range 
 tree stump garvey shouldnt hof
skyjack ive said lot nasty things about skyjack last
year so mostly response mediots woofers who talk
about morris ability win which nothing more than morris ability
 pitch when toronto score tons runs point morris 
average pitcher although from his early returns he may damned 
close done all fairness morris dominant pitcher 
s upanddown tiger teams while obviously great year
 detroit rest decade team generally contention 
 favorites morris career numbers quite good worthy hof
consideration 
ryan course careful i guarantee you someone 
throw back your earlier logic about yount smith being shortstops who 
hung around long time after all nolan never won cy damn hes 
just pitcher who hung around years his wl record mediocre
 course nolans hofer
puck probably although hes got play reasonably well few
more years years even good ones arent enough make hof most
likely said i believe puckett make hof pretty much
regardless how rest his career turns out barring something really 
tragic sudden hes very popular media fans 
legitimately has been one best cfs game since he joined 
league ive always liked guy i hope he does make 
end i think puck make really its too early sell

 debate comes up rather frequently net believe 
 i never tire its interesting subject heres off
 top my head list potential hofers from each team i probably
left couple guys off so feel free follow up i wont consider anyone
who started playing after about again too early tell note 
 all active players im counting recent retirees

baltimore cal ripken should lock now even gehrigs record stands
boston roger clemens might lock already which amazing dawson 
detroit alan trammell lou whitaker possibilities
milwaukee robin yount discussed earlier
new york wade boggs possibly mattingly long shot
toronto paul molitor jack morris possibilities

kansas city george brett lock
minnesota kirby too early tell winfield lock
oakland eckersley lock mcgwire too early rickey lock welch long shot
texas mighty nolan too early consider canseco strange 

cubs sandberg lock
st louis ozzie lock lee smith probably
new york murray almost lock saberhagen obviously hes got regain
 past form
 most certainly vince coleman despite what hell tell you 

los angeles butler strawberry hershiser all long shots
san diego tony gwynn pretty good shot
colorado dale murphy good shot ryan bowen just see youre awake

before i get flames offthetopofthehead list theres
probably few deserving candidates i left off i didnt include
barry bonds clark any atlanta starting pitcher frank thomas canseco
mcgriff etc because i only considered guys who started playing before


email post i almost fear what i may have started here


bruce hasch haschjhuvmshcfjhuedu sell team eli
