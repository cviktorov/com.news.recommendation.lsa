going over some videos last night

studying videotapes jose canseco proved very
interesting enlightening

heres my analysis jose canseco circa sep jose canseco
circa june 

 hes bulked up too much period he needs lose about pounds
 gain more bulk

 his bat speed has absolutely vanished conservatively id say hes
 lost his bat speed thats huge amount speed

 open stance killing him note he acts sort like
 brian downing way open start closes up ball 
 released downing could do without significant head movement 
 canseco cant also note canseco doesnt always close his
 stance same way sometimes his hips open sometimes
 theyre fully closed without good starting point its hard
 make adjustments your swing

what would i do i were jose

aside from salting away large sum cash i could never touch
so id never have work again id restructure my entire swing

first minimize movement before swing close widen stance
 severely cut down stride i take my swing hopefully 
 cut down time i need swing allow me move
 bathead more freely

second drop pounds cut out weight work

third relax wrists cost some power until i can find
my stroke concentrate keeping back shoulder up rolling
 wrists through strike zone hit line drives his strength
 more than enough so some those line drives get out 
 park

 cansecos open stance resulting bad habits result his back
problems hell out baseball three years he could
still hit hr
