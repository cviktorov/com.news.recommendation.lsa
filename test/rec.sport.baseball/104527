does any one out listen wfan those you who do
 know what i am talking about all sports radio
staion new york clear night signal reaches up 
down east coast particular i want know how len
berman mike lupicas show i go school virginia
so i cant listen when during day just
wondering

youre right about signal being strong i live west philadelphia
 i can get fan almost perfectly its sports fans dream especially
 person from ny wants hear about his teams while hes
away school lupica berman its turned out lupica
 berman neither them wanted work full four hour show so ed
coleman dave sims old fourhour slot broken down two
seperate twohour show lupica from berman from 
both happen suck comparison eddie dave come back guys


 fan okay sports radio station doesnt come close 
 ultimate sports radio wip philadelphia signal
might powerful again only stations new york
feel obligated pollute everyone elses airwaves bunch 
hoodlum mets fans complaining hours day wip took two your
best sports jockeys too jody macdonald steve fredericks 
wip rockin sports talk from am till midnight check 
out anytime your within few hours philadelphia im 
mistaken wip has highest sports talk ratings nation


like i said i live philly so i can hear fan andor wip whenever i
want i cannot stand wip isnt because i loathe philly
sports teams phillies my favorite nl team yanks favorite
al eagles arent too bad either two big problems

total emphasis home teams especially eagles unlike
 fan hosts who can least answer question about 
 outoftown team caller asks wip hosts seem
 have clue about any team doesnt play 
 broad street also fans periodic sports updates every 
 minutes gives sports news scores from around 
 country its very rare hear outoftown score
 being reported wip

 hosts exception jody macdonald who i miss
 from his days fan none hosts really seems have
 both broad knowledge sport good onair presence
 worst gary cobb who seems have been hired solely
 basis he used play eagles

anyway thats my two cents whole fan vs wip battle
