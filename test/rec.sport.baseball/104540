guess which line which
baobpslgabhbbhrbb
x
y

 walks should give away obps general somewhat more valuable than
slugging alomars edge obp quite bit larger than baergas edge
 slugging

im sdcn whats more valuable

 hits w more doubles more hrs 
 more triples bbs lets forget extra sbs how many cs

 course hits homers more valuable

 dont forget outs you cant have both ways baergas higher
raw numbers due him having more playing time thus he had more
hits homers dont forget cost those outs

btw just answer your question alomar had sb cs baerga had
 sb cs which gives minute plus alomars side

something else consider

alomars hr splits were slg obp baergas 
 pretty clearly alomar got huge boost from his home park

id say you could make good them being about equal right now tp
rated baerga higher actually
