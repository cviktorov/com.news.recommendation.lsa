 hi baseball fans so what do you say dont you think he deserves 
i
mean heck dave winfield hohum seriously being considered 

 lee smith ha why dont we give dave kingman chance darrell
evans yeah yeah after hall fame takes them can take 
eddie
murray jeff reardon

unfortunately you seem lack ability rate players dave
winfield has had better career than half people hall 
fame eddie murray darrel evans both one top players
 all time lee smith has had probably greatest long career
 any relief pitcher since possible exception gossage

 other hand kingman probably isnt one best players
 all time

 reardon though good pitcher isnt smiths class career wise

 well any case i am sick tired mostly sick everybody
giving
hall fame consideration players todays standards
marginal

honestly ozzie smith robin yount dont belong theyre both
shortstops just hung around long time big deal

were talking top players all time here probably
arent shortstops history who were better than two

 lets little more selective huh stop handing out honors
so
liberally save them guys who really deserve face 
something
isnt done little prestige hall fame anymore when
certain individuals believe steve garvey jack morris potential
candidates absurdity apparent

garvey sucked morris while very good pitcher simply doesnt
belong near cooperstown

 gee can guys even compare 
 more likely future hall famers like kirby puckett nolan ryan

 puckett ryan okay get hall 
marginal hall famers unless puckett keeps hitting like he did last year 
 while longer

 put perspective heres listing linear weights
values careers players you mention parenthesis
 how high up greatest ever list make 
while one would claim perfect rankings should give
you good value guys careers compared average players

robin yount 
ozzie smith 
dave winfield 
eddie murray 
darrel evans 
kirby puckett 
nolan ryan 
jack morris 
dave kingman 
steve garvey 

 give you idea how numbers compare those hall
 eligible players whose career stats equaled hall
 fame ones who arent include th century players ron santo bobby
grich bob johnson

 those eligible who score between 
those eligible who score between
