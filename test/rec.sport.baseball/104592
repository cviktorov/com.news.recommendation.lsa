i dont have history handy i dont recall preponderance
 roys come from winning teams fact i think team performance 
generally irrelevant almost always most deserving candidate wins
am i wrong

 really though i wouldnt personally say most deserving
candidate wins rarely does player win roy when called up mid
season have been several duds recent years 
more factor mediot biases than anything else i wonder 
amaral hits like he capable he receive roty votes hes
only he could have long career ahead him 

 he necessarily losing team while angels staff
 still very weak everyday lineup doing quite well thank
you snow playing great salmon learning make adjustments
easley appears fine even hes flora ready come up
between gonzales gruber theyll manage hot corner polonia
 curtis steady heady even myers orton contributing

personally i think can finish over which makes them 
winning team

i think seconddivision team should finish ahead 
 royals mariners possibly athletics i dont think
theyll above i think east stronger year

last year pitching bad offense horrible 
year offense better pitching still pretty bad
even finley returns form he wont replace what lost 
abbott sanderson farrell i dont believe 

 while ba may good have decent speed 
offense lacks punch dont have any bona fide power hitters
salmon snow davis curtis none more than hr
potential

cheers
valentine

ps which al team had most steals last week those gogo tigers
 mediots finally managed convince them needed more
balance lineup you see were scoring too many runs
too consistently gotta run more break up
