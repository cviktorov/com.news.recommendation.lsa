media beating incident dodger stadium wednesday 
death i havent seen anything rsb yet

gerald perry cardinals pinch hit eighth inning two
 his club down run he stroked line drive 
right field corner ball cleared threefoot high fence 
went crowd darryl racing over from right center got 
 spot time reach his glove up over short fence he
missed ball fan sitting front row wearing mitt
reached up caught ball home run

now ive seen replay several times i have concluded 
darryl missed ball fans glove essentially
behind darryls several dodger fans seats immediate
vicinity have claimed fan unquestionably interfered 
strawberry what cannot disputed however fan
who caught ball never took his eye off he oblivious
 where fielder playing he also quite exuberant 
soon he realized he had made catch

 exuberance disappeared immediately however when strawberry
went tirade man all reports indicate he used lot
 profanity accused man interference therefore 
costing dodgers game shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food beverages toward man who made catch dodger stadium
officials started remove him from park relented 
just relocated him another area interview after game
lasorda blamed fan loss strawberry also went 
tirade about how fans stupid dont care about 
winning la times columnists similarly blasted man who made
 catch

before each dodger game public address announcer makes speech
wherein he says fans welcome souvenirs balls 
 hit stands long do interfere any 
 field play fan wrong should he have
been more aware situation acted avoid any possibility
 interference he human just reacting way he
 season ticket holder his request dodgers have relocated
his seats another area stadium where future interference 
impossible

others have questioned why darryl should so concerned what
 fan did when he has grand total rbi through first
nine games

i question what he doing right center lefthanded pull
hitter up game line had he been closer play
he certainly would have had much better chance catching ball

 i guess big debate continues what responsibilities
 fan
