 fourth inning astacio had already made about pitches 
 score still dodger defense made several impressive
plays piazza looked great behind plate gunning down runner
trying steal second throwing runner out first who
had strayed bit from first base etc
 
karros also made spectacular play keeping ball from going 
 outfield runner first so sure ball going
through he just kept running past second karros got up threw
 third easily got runner third
 
my heart sank th when gross got up warm up bullpen
 
astacio lifted pinch hitter when gross entered game
 score still dodger fans just knew over
 
gross relieving because he stunk tuesday pitching just 
innings forcing lasorda use much his bullpen inning
game had same effect next nightso only gross fresh
given his light work out tuesday
 
gross lived up his name he walked first batter gave up hit
 second walked bases loaded after grounder resulted
 force home zeile lifted scoring fly ball make 
 cards gross paid little attention runners next
thing you knew cards had stolen fourth run runner 
first eventually tagged out run down th run had
scored long before 
 
meanwhile dodgers mounted little offense after second inning
lee smith pitched ninth he had little trouble getting karros
 wallach does anyone have trouble wallach days
cory snyder collected his first hit dodger single 
 all offense dodgers could mount smith got his
third straight save against dodgers all i got my
free dodger cap good look piazza piazza keeps 
up all year he strong candidate rookie year
