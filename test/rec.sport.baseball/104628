 all i am talking about morris winning toronto last year you 
 about launch fantasy about red jays how toronto
would have done viola team viola didnt play toronto 
last year morris did

 problem your nihilistic approach roger takes all 
sense out game your line reasoning guy hits 
double play one out bases loaded theres point saying
 bad thing do his team won anyway speculating
 what might have happened things had gone otherwise so double
play merely event happened course game 
eventually won lost unknown reasons after all any speculation
involves constructing fantasy about what would have happened didnt

roger do you ever worry next pencil you drop fall 
ceiling instead you willing consider empirical evidence

teams go postseason when win more games than anybody else
 division dont make postseason dont win 
series you agree winning division useful intermediate
goal ringcollecting

 so you must agree winning games useful intermediate goal
towards winning division our disagreements come when we consider
how win games

 your viewpoint expressed winning games happens reasons 
cannot analyzed while many us thinking things like base
runners good outs bad therefore walks better than
double plays bases loaded you thinking things like
its team game so perhaps double play cause some mysterious
team dynamics cause team win today

 result becomes impossible say anything about individual
players perhaps atlanta would have won series me playing left
field after all perhaps some way my knowledge personality would
have helped team more than my complete lack skill would have hurt
 therefore i could extremely valuable player did dave winfield
have anything do jays victory probably how do you know
 you replace him andres galarraga perhaps jays would have won
perhaps would have lost perhaps would have defected alpha
centauri bearing mind flying saucers would have landed
 midseason had winfield been dhing toronto

 babe ruth good player he played some wswinning teams did
he have anything do success

 generally accepted ernie banks good baseball player 
jarvis brown dan schatzeder werent seems me anybody who
would deny needs provide proof

now we have observed things about baseball over years both empirically
 looking rulebook necessary score more runs than
ones opponent win game so would seem important score runs
 prevent ones opponent from scoring runs scored while team
 batting inning ends after third out so would seem 
making outs bad while hitting home runs good players have tendencies
 hit pitch certain levels usually somewhat consistent
from year year

we do use statistics predict winners so do you make
some flat predictions barry bonds have higher obpslg than
gene larkin year braves finish ahead rockies
 standings tigers score more runs than royals 
 also give up more i would astonished any turned
out false i suspect so would you matter fact i
am pretty sure i can predict all division winners year given
 guesses per division certainly better than random
chance almost statistically significant

 you admit rockies mariners unlikely meet 
 world series you must admit some sort way measure
likelihoods however fuzzy

 impossible all other things equal so your fantasy totally
meaningless

so how about real life person robs service station two people
 using automatic pistol gets convicted sentenced
 three years person b similar criminal record robs service
station two people using revolver gets 
convicted since used two different types handgun comparisons
totally meaningless

say you drop pencil see gravity still works my cats always
testing dont trust me pay gravity bill time you
have never dropped pencil exact time century before so
all previous evidence meaningless would you surprised flew
out window instead hitting desk

david thornley who has replica world series rings does have tickets
 world series metrodome
