dont you guys think so i mean cmon what heck women doing
even thinking getting baseball cause so many problems just

assuming youre serious i guess youd surprised hear
 us guys dont think so i would guess tiny fraction
 folks reading your post agree i kind 
doubt even you agree 

sheesh i agree you here dave anyone starting
recsportsidiots guys like austin

 i am starting recsportsidiots people who respond obvious
flamebait

nah lets reserve recsportsidiots people who post
obvious flamebait like yourself

 someone posts something controversial mention
idiotic what austin posted widely accessed newsgroup
someone should challenge statement school
 thought suggests silence consent whereas
 idea may apply everything life certainly
should apply forum public discussion which rsb


 youve been reading rsb lately youll find
 even elementary school children have had access

think little more carefully about some things i post

 conclusion someone like austin wants post his drivel
 some obscure newsgroup i dont read fine hes got 
right rant rave drool all he wants name
 free speech he drools newsgroup i read
 i support right anyone provide rebuttal
 his drooling

now course you dont have read any 
 you want cut down flames
