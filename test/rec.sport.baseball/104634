i suppose foul ball machine like brett butler pretty valuable
 id rather watch root lower obp guys who can
actually hit ball

now legitimate point baseball entertainment i have 
quarrel people who find certain styles play more entertaining than
others regardless winvalue personally im huge fan 
slugbunt i doubt its highpercentage play i get big kick out 
 i am willing live bad consequences exchange fun

 course same claiming some do galarragas
inability defer gratification isnt hurting his team because he isnt
paid walk rbi guy whatever

 finally id like point out many high obp guys draw 
 walks more because pitchers afraid throw strike
 them than because have great eye

im sure i used think true more more im becoming
convinced its other way around among players physical
ability hit ball real hard patient ones ones who get 
chance do lot

lets break down four basic categories hitter according whether
 power threats whether walk lot


powerno power

patientfrank thomasbrett butler
barry bondsozzie smith
mark mcgwirecraig grebeck
babe ruthmiller huggins
ted williamsbilly hamilton
rickey hendersoneddie joost
joe morganmike hargrove
 
 
 

impatienternie banksozzie guillen
dave kingmanshawon dunston
joe carterandres thomas
george belljose lind
kirby puckettdevon white
etc

 far i can tell all categories full really looks like 
two independent nobody could possibly afraid craig grebeck 
 plate yet he walks quite lot part undoubtedly being
small stature surely major league pitchers can hit sort 
target least times out randy milligan even better example
hes only shown noticeable power one partial season he walks all
over place despite his huge strike zone
