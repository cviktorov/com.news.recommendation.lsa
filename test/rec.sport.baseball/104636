 hed been thrown out gant had legitimate beef about
 pitch called strike reasonable umpire would
 have tried force gant back box situation

 reasonable umpire would do hes been instructed do season get
 batters back box sooner try cut down ridiculous
length games i one am glad see happen hope more
umpires do hirschbeck did instructing pitcher pitch 
 batter wont get back box 

so what previous strike call bogus its past cant
 changed get back deal next pitch 

sorry sherri i cant agree particular incident while
im all cutting down number chainrattles other examples
 rampant hargroving difference here

 since time immemorial batters have complained about calls
so have pitchers catchers usually nothing happens
unless league notified teams year about allowing
complaints hirschbeck acting against expectations

 its gant hirschbecks face gant said
something about call stepped out box turned away
from hirschbeck hitter alibet little consequence 
 decent eye whenever receiving short end stick
 questionable call id want moment two out box
 other reason than rethink strike zone based 
 experience last pitch i really angry
 ump id rather turn away catch my breath than
turn him say something might get me tossed
especially key moment game

when gant turned away hirschbeck immediately motioned gant
 step box imo point time hirschbeck
 determined show gant exactly who charge game
gant wasnt dawdling he hadnt had chance dawdle hirschbeck
 simply exercising power play gant resisted many 
us might what we thought unreasonable request 
hirschbeck called pitch point cox came out 
 field pitch thrown many other braves left 
dugout cox tossed protecting his player i pleasantly
surprised gant kept his cool enough stay game

its small sample size based what i saw game
mark hirschbeck has hairtrigger temper need play
god field good qualities umpire i 
keep my eyes open future appearances hirschbeck 
future order improve my sample size

imo any game where you remember name umpire 
 bad game umpire
