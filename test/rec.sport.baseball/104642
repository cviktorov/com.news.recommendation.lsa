 i am starting recsportsidiots people who respond 
obvious flamebait

nah lets reserve recsportsidiots people who post
obvious flamebait like yourself

funny i didnt realize mr tanner brought up bob knepper v pam postema
 first place thought someone named jacobs

 someone posts something controversial mention
idiotic what austin posted widely accessed newsgroup
someone should challenge statement 

why statement truly idiotic universally thought so
 challenge waste panting further challenges have
nothing yes nothing do baseball wasting others time

you got problem what bob knepper thinks lets hear 
some sort categorical manner actually i question whether either
knepper postema arent old news point although what i
have read postemas book interesting

 school thought suggests silence consent 

i agree far

whereas idea may apply everything life certainly
should apply forum public discussion

sez you

 youve been reading rsb lately youll find
 even elementary school children have had access
 our postings albeit edited form its making me
think little more carefully about some things i post

 does come out what you say down road here

 conclusion someone like austin wants post his drivel
 some obscure newsgroup i dont read fine hes got 
right rant rave drool all he wants name
 free speech he drools newsgroup i read
 i support right anyone provide rebuttal
 his drooling

yo even elementary school children have had access our postings
albeit edited form you want them hear you talk like 
dont you want people who come group talk baseball think
you like do same do you want them think youre some 
politically correct demagogue whos ohso sensitive hohum

plus youre here limiting free speech some obscure newsgroup 
i dont read what bs you got problem what jacobs says what
knepper thinks all you have do defeat better ideas more
 better speech yours easy way out

 knepper ever notice how sometimes guys say just about
any darn thing pops heads when mike shoved front 
them you know often best copy news one isnt
preprepared know knepper has controversial ideas about women 
pop some question about postema interesting related question would 
 whether two ever appeared same game off top my head
i guess my guess right knepper popped off about something 
had nothing do him postema gets book he doesnt

now course you dont have read any 
 you want cut down flames dont post flamebait
you dont have respond flames either saves cyberspace

now why didnt i think
