you want speed up ballgames

 enforce two minutes between innings many fields 
 allowing three minutes between them fifteen seconds before 
 tv commercials gone thirty so before action begins upon
 return game two minutes last out first pitch 
 ball called

 dont grant time batters just because want may get
 pissed first theyll get line once anything pitcher
 throws while theyre adjusting wristbands strike

 mandate rule permitting only n seconds between pitches current
 rule too lenient enforce fifteen seconds more
 than enough time pitch isnt released call ball
 restart clock

baseball games take about nl just shade under hours
 al thats just too damn long i dont like play hour
games much less watch game long my butt falls asleep 
 im watching tv ill channel surf between pitches catching
colorized versions mr ed leave beaver those wacky
