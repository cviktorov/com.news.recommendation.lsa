 facts morris
 has shown us he has what takes play ws winning club
 clemens hasnt 

what does take play ws winning club

we have way knowing because we cannot separate morris contribu
tion from rest teams only one way determin
ing best baseball looking scoreboard 
 end game each game determines which team best
 day end season team best 
most often best division playoffs determine 
best best point only decision making pro
cess used determine best score game re
lates teams individual players method
inherent baseball comparing individual performances 
 how should because after all baseball team game

 say one player better than another able say ab
solutely player team would have played better player b
 lineup sheer speculation impossible ascertain

 you want select group statistics claim clemens has
done better those statistics criteria fine you
have able prove those statistics measure 
individuals contribution winning ws because 
only measure best has any meaning context base
ball so until you can prove clemens contributes ws cham
pionship more than morris your evaluation clemens totally sub
jective mere opinion i have yet see any you can
predict ws winner any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon

 fact morris didnt win any ballgames toronto did 
spite morris contribution has been explained you

exactly jays won morris pitching boston wins 
clemens pitching i am saying morris better than clemens
i am saying individual comparisons between players totally
meaningless anyone claiming clemens better based 
his era has missed point what baseball all about

many many times you either too stupid too stubborn grasp 

you dont have rude

you completely consumed post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy

 you say means you have either missed entire point
 my argument you yourself have committed fallacy ignoratio
elenchi i am saying morris better than clemens because
he has more rings although i have tongue cheek claimed
 past i am saying impossible isolate 
individuals performance from his teams purpose 
comparing individuals performance another individuals per
formance

 stats nice hobby thats about new
knowledge being produced so when poster claims morris better
than clemens because he has more rings poster more nor less 
incorrect than rest you baying hounds
