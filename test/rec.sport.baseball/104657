 you want speed up ballgames

 enforce two minutes between innings many fields 
 allowing three minutes between them fifteen seconds before 
 tv commercials gone thirty so before action begins upon
 return game two minutes last out first pitch 
 ball called

 dont grant time batters just because want may get
 pissed first theyll get line once anything pitcher
 throws while theyre adjusting wristbands strike

 mandate rule permitting only n seconds between pitches current
 rule too lenient enforce fifteen seconds more
 than enough time pitch isnt released call ball
 restart clock


ive only ever seen called once back around i think
 steve carlton pitching other hand i am sure how
much effect would have seems most time lost 
when runners base rule does cover 


i have wondered why pitcher given pitches when he enters 
game lets serious relief pitcher has normally been
throwing out bullpen few minutes does he really need 
more pitches
