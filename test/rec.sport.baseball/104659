i hesitate make assumptions about other people when write 
neither you two sound though you have kids you may have
spouses either

i wonder why you say i dont see why having spouse andor
kids would have anything do might you brought
your kids game wanted them get home time get
 bed reasonable hour which case id probably decide
 take my kids games weekends many people do else
 prepared leave game early from what you say later
 you dont bring your kids your spouse game
 happens i have husband kids my husband usually
attends games me

extra innings could put me
well past midnight even without extra innings score beyond
 i cant see my family night all next day workday
i may have bag well 

i can see its problem you dont bring your wife ballgame
 thats problem even game goes trim hours far
 bagging work next day i dont really understand why thats
necessary unless going game also means you consume vast
quantities beer i note case many guys
 you dont think you can get up go work after long evening
out dont have long evenings out during week

all stuff enters my consideration even going game 
you say you dont care about whether game sped up impo you 
saying you dont care where time goes game people
who dont have families dont have get up work next day

look i pay between apiece tickets plus 
 parking plus spending my time energy driving from boston 
plus spending additional money concessions etc ballpark 
i see going game considerable investment time money
i cant afford go lot games hence going game 
big deal like going play opera maybe you have more money than 
i do can go games all year long so its big deal you 
 im interested having games sped up any more than i want 
have die walkure cut down convenient weeknight version two
hours i felt going night game during week would interfere 
 my family life my work life id choose go weekend game
