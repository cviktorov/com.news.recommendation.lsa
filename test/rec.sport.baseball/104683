well actually most ours based what really happened yours 
based some fantasy how happened thats ok i understand you
have hockey background stats like plusminus make rbi look good

 violas fault boston had offense because morris 
 blue jays had strong offense dont tell me morris has 
magical ability cause offensive players score more runs
 perfect example your problem you isolating violas
contribution from rest teams efforts you can only do
 you can say sure what team would have done without 
viola only can you compare you cannot know how team
would have done without viola your analysis fallacious

ok how about straigh answer heres very simele question which
im sure fair number us very interesed answer please
answer yes roger
 can pitcher cause offensive players his team score more runs
al only please

 anyone else following along wellknown demonstrable fact
 teams winloss record closely related number runs 
team scores number team allows its definite
hardandfast function definitely correlation fact 
rule thumb teams b both score x runs team allows y runs
 every runs fewer than y team b allows win another game
so instance we look toronto blue jays we find 
 scored runs allowed which morris allowed all other
things being equal frank viola his era had replaced jack
morris innings morris threw plausible since viola threw 
 boston red jays would have allowed about fewer runs 
enough more wins now doesnt take account viola
pitched half his innings fenway which harder park pitch 
particularly lefthander than skydome so um roger unless you
really do believe pitcher can somehow affect number runs
his team scores could you enlighten us fallacy 
analysis clearly would foolhardy claim viola would
necessarily have put up he had been jay last year 
 claim we look what actual performances were 
evaluate violas better than morris sense had morris
performed viola did his team would have been better off

 takes open mind really truly understand what happening out
here real world guys

 true so open your brain falls out
