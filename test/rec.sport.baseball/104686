 article msscqrrzhnetcomcom mssnetcomcom mark singer says


 why would owners decrease ticket prices when obviously get
 lots people pay price theyre asking


i dont think obvious lots people willing
 pay price im sure someone out netland has some
facts about trends attendance regarding percentage capacity
sold even trends relatively flat you have consider
what happening teambyteam basis

when tv money dries up franchises seeking supplant 
lost revenues from alternative sources one best sources may
 ticket sales

example dodgers

 dodgers can count strong base season ticket sales
 probably believe have ability raise
prices without hindering revenues i certainly think 
true

example padres

 lucky average fans game year
 raise prices less want increase 
overall revenue base best thing can do put 
winning team field given wont happen 
wont can probably make more money lowering ticket
prices running frequent promotions do 
i have idea wont increase prices because 
wont work them


 even assuming you have some strange power make owners
 decrease ticket prices does decrease tv contract


 only strange powers work here forces market place
each teams market somewhat different each owner going 
 faced unique set circumstances about how deal those
market forces buiness manager i would never want lower my
prices sometimes strategy necessary sometimes works
you have consider everything you want continued success
