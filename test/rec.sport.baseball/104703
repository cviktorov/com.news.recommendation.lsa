tim shippert recently posted summaries last years defensive average
stats terms linear weights estimated runvalue defensive
performances compared league average ive combined those my
positionadjusted mlv numbers come up firstapproximation total
run values players last year we can use springboard 
reconsideration mvp award

major caveats numbers include defensive park adjustment so 
san diego really just question odd scoring gopher holes 
infield cause some inaccuracies offensive numbers 
positionadjusted park adjusted so we have deflate some 
inflate others fair finally we still dont know what do about
catchers i have idea how evaluate defensive contributions 
 tony phillips bip roberts 

having said still some surprises lets look national
league first all numbers total runs contributed over season

playeroffensedefensetotal

sandberg 
bonds 
walker 
justice 
daulton 
larkin 
grace 

 i see legitimate mvp candidates from last season
 you deflate sandbergs offense wee bit playing wrigley you
get essentially dead heat had bonds been his usual defensive self 
wouldnt have been close apparently wasnt case darren
daulton needs more defensive runs make up offensive difference
 i couldnt tell you whether thats easy impossible good case 
could made any sandberg bonds daulton top dude

my personal vote bonds sandberg daulton walker justice


 american league

playeroffensedefensetotal

ventura 
martinez 
b anderson 
thomas 
r henderson 
raines 
tettleton 

ok lets see show hands how many you picked robin ventura top
player al last year i certainly didnt id have hard time
arguing against him point yes i know numbers only
approximate thats big gap between him guy also those
 you who thought rickey henderson stank last year out your minds

once again theres catcher ointment calling game 
important might runs easy make up give away take
 guess folks i dont think we can do any better than 

my personal vote excluding pitchers

ventura tettleton anderson martinez henderson

im big frank thomas fan i have admit bias favor 
balanced offensivedefensive contribution which should have higher
leverage wl record than equal shift lots offense 
negative defense

 record

carlos baerga 
roberto alomar 

forget its wash

let me also take opportunity admit i grossly wrong regarding
don mattinglys defense past season don recovered brilliantly from his
weak end up 

mattingly runs

which clearly aboveaverage first baseman however its still runs
behind mark mcgwire runs behind frank thomas runs behind john
olerud other hand its ahead rafael palmeiro cecil fielder 
every other al first baseman yet mentioned
