 you want speed up ballgames
 
 mandate rule permitting only n seconds between pitches current
 rule too lenient enforce fifteen seconds more
 than enough time pitch isnt released call ball
 restart clock
 
i remember post from last year indicating pitch clock tried
 one minor leagues some time back did work i dont remember
why said did work anyone remember 

jody mcdonnel wip phil has been saying pitch clock 
inevitable how would pitch clock work throws first

another pair suggestions
 remove balk rule runners responsibility stay safe
 matter what pitcher does

 pitcher throws occupied base more than x time x 
 without successfully picking off runner runner advances base
 walked

 nobalk seems give pitcher advantage basewalk allows
 runner challenge pitcher throw over base

 baseball games take about nl just shade under hours
 al thats just too damn long i dont like play hour
 games much less watch game long my butt falls asleep 
 im watching tv ill channel surf between pitches catching
 colorized versions mr ed leave beaver those wacky

i too find myself surfing when i know enough time between
each pitch allow batter adjust his jewlery
