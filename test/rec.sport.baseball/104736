 reason i bothered doing dr stuff see i could
determine answer ageold question jeff blauser more
valuable than rafael belliard

well looks like just doug trumped tim beating him net
 his defensive analyses so tim has gotten ahead me

 way i doing little different being me course i
used equivalent averages work out how many runs player worth
 i calculated both rate performance fielding equivalent
average total performance fielding equivalent runs i
compared average player replacement player 
heres why because positional adjustment comes built 
system al average ss runs above
replacement rar cf b b lf rf 
b we may quibble exact numbers order looks
substantially right

 equivalent average i have always set league average i
had decided hitting replacement level batter has eqa 
 name replacement level hitter often 
billy ripken i decided let replacement level fielder 
same distance from opposite direction i
have set up makes eqa yes i can add runs
 proportional eqa squared difference between squared
 squared equals difference squared i rounded
off simplicity allreplacement fielding team would have
randy milligan first willie randolph second leo
gomez third walt weiss short kevin bass 
 left hojo center eric anthony right ugh

so total number rar player sum his batting 
fielding rar i can rate them total rar rar per some number 
batting outs like average player has total rar about 
 batting fielding
