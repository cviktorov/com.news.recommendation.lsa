 finally id like point out many high obp guys draw 
 walks more because pitchers afraid throw strike
 them than because have great eye

im sure i used think true more more im becoming
convinced its other way around among players physical
ability hit ball real hard patient ones ones who get 
chance do lot

lets break down four basic categories hitter according whether
 power threats whether walk lot

okay i think we all agree singles hitters should take 
strike two try get base any way can

so powerimpatient guys have excuse
 powerpatient guys doing right thing

now impatientpower guys how could you leave out big cat
would guys have better slugging percentage took
more pitches perhaps i doubt you tell joe carter
 go up take few pitches he draw more walks 
he also wont hit many frozen ropes bleachers because
he more likely hold back pitch he used drive

 patientpower guys joe morgan had small strike zone 
rickey henderson has strike zone size hitlers heart 
so get walks based small zone

look other guys thomas bonds mcgwire ruth williams wow
 lot pitchers would rather nibble corners maybe
walk guys throw clear strike them
 pitchers would do better my opinion just coming after
them good fastball strike first pitch pitchers
would rather nibble go get hurt
