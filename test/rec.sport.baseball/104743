rule k states interference batter runner when 
 running last half distance from home base first base
 he runs outside threefoot line inside left 
 foul line umpires judgment interferes field
er taking throw first base

 key word rule runner isnt out just running
out baseline hes out interfering fielding 
ball throw fielding throw first because catcher
opted throw ball over batterrunners head theres inter
ference



so what your definition interfering fielder taking throw

 rule book certainly doesnt have definiton clarification so its
possible interpret rule saying catcher has alter
his throw avoid hitting batterrunner again we have interference
you know seems way apply rule justlyif 
catcher pitcher say rob dibble example throws toward first
 hits runner running inside baseline fielder takes chance
 being ejected therefore he probably would throw around runner 
your scenario above him

you should note our american legion league which uses mlb rules we
interpret rule say very circumstance interference
per rule
