 before folks jump me let me ask net would jays
 have won al good pitcher from aaa place morris given
 his run support how about average ml pitcher i cant believe
 morris performance playoffs series had large positive
 impact jays performance 
i know its very trendy nowadays dump morris lets give credit
where credit due
 doubtful blue jays would have won al east without morris
last year when team went month august all 
other starters were being shelled milwaukee making charge
morris went pretty good era i cant remember exactly
also lets underestimate importance his innings save 
 bullpen every fifth day he didnt help us win al east forget
about pennent world series

 guy who threw innings about run lower era would have saved 
bullpen even more say somebody like frank viola innings

his run support high runs so stottlemyers runs
 he won only games i do remember morris winning inordinate number 
 ballgames his credit he pitched only good
 he needed when he up ballgame he just put cruise
control threw ball up let batters get themseleves out
i hate expression inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying make perfect pitches keep his era down morris being 
veteran pitcher knows winning only thing really matters 
baseball saving himself he able reach back little extra
i hate too when game line

nice audition tape send 
 baseball tonight

have you chance taken look boxscores from last year 
determine accuracy your account i seem recall morris getting 
least wins last year when jays came back from behind after 
had decided pull morris end inning
