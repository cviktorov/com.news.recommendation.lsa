while i can see why want cut down time spent walking around
gant wasnt ordered back box sooner he ordered back immediately
 soon he stepped out hirschbeck told him get back box
now gant doesnt take lot walks between pitches only reason
he did because he very bothered call i expect his
concentration wasnt yet crucial situation i imagine its
best calm possible contributing factors would gants
bad day plate bad year plate braves long scoring
drought

 hirschbecks job help gant any difficulties
 gant cant gather his concentration whatever reason just makes
him all more meat batters box umpires job 
maintain flow play gant entitled time regather his
faculties

nor anyone else

now its pretty stupid go ahead talk walk when umpire 
telling you get you know umpire going do something
call strike throw you out etc gant wrong

absolutely i think itd more accurate say gant foolish

 hirschbeck more wrong my biased view aside from major chip
he seemed have his shoulder what problem gant had reason
 want some time disputed strike call 

 disputed strike call ample reason timeout games would last
about ninefifteen weeks jack morris dave whiner stieb were
pitching disputed strike call sufficient time out
suck up get back box never badmouth blue theyre
 going change mind youre just going come across
 pinhead which wont help you borderline calls

ftr i never speak umpires when i dont know them personally nor
do i glance them react calls result i think i get more
than my fair share borderline calls plate because i have 
rep having good eye actually lot negative
connotations go rep including copious questions about
my masculinity party affiliation sexual preference

gant hadnt been wasting time all
game game had been cruising along just over two hours old

irrelevant he wasting time 

 score outs ninth runner scoring position
 any reason hirschbeck couldnt shouldnt cut gant little
slack 

 because its his job

 because setting precedent cutting slack can easily 
 extend those hour games kind like phantom dp

 discernible constructive reason hirschbeck disrupted 
game caused five minute delay materially hurt batter key
situation did he have date get 

gant hurt himself braves disrupted game your biases 
exposed im sitting here defending umpires sf giants
which like phyllis schlafly defending gary segura jack kevorkian
 swedish abortion team 

 i still wonder why terry tossed earlier game

i believe terry said magic word some truly quick ways
 get tossed from ballgame primer email me

good ways get tossed from game

 ask ken kaiser he got his money back from nutrisystem
 kiss rich garcia lips say hi honey im home
 goose eric gregg
 ask bruce froemming his parents had any children lived
 get naked

source greg spira book diamond ettiquette told 
 peter gammons collier press
