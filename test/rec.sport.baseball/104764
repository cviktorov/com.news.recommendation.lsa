i agree nick whats big deal about long games you want
 watch baseball theres much more baseball watch yes
baseball includes space between plays well plays themselves

first longer game way suggests more baseball watch unless
you include watching grass grow baseball lengthier games
 so because batters stepping out box pitchers taking
longer between pitches excessive trips mound managers
 pitching coaches


until six seven years ago i enthusiastic fan nfl football
last year i hardly watched game what turned me off were 
incessant interruptions continuity game team scores
 minutes commercials kickoff minutes commercials
three downs punt minutes commercials aaaaarrrrgh

earlier thread i commented larussa whom i
believe institutionalize slow play i dont mind catandmouse
game rickey first fact i rather enjoy similarly
i would enjoy battle listach lofton polonia first what
i object when games played karkovice first
 when game blowout i dont mind when pitcher steps off 
 mound gather his thoughts crucial situation when hitter
steps out box regain his concentration what i object 
 when hitters pitchers take breaks every opportunity
when game exciting little delays serve tension builders
 me enhance value experience game when 
delays happen regularity become nuisances just like 
commercial breaks football 

i understand nfl imposed number rule changes speed up
 games basically putting onus officiating staff move
 markers ball spots faster did address
 problem continuity game may have appeased 
sponsors networks i would amazed did anything
 enhance experience fans

similary while some hour baseball games bore me tears those 
ones where continuity players taking exasperatingly
long periods get ready each pitch i doubt anyone watching
 bravesgiants game cared about gant stepping out i doubt anyone
watching game would have found pause anything 
opportunity have complete attention claimed drama 
 present i would totally opposed any effort would
eliminate aspect baseball

 other hand i wish baseball had commissioner powerful
enough sit down aldersonlarussaduncan explain 
 actually hurting product baseball dragging games 
out way do i sure wouldnt mind little armtwisting
