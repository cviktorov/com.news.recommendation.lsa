 my computerized baseball game i keep track category called
stolen hits defined play made average fielder would 
make average effort using defensive averages posted
 sherri nichols thanks sherri ive figured out some defensive stats
 leftfielders hits stolen have been redefined plays kevin
bass would have made

ok i realize thats unfair kevins probably victim pitching staff
fluke shots monster park factor lets put way we
replaced every leftfielder league someone kevins out
making ability how many extra hits would go 

 try correlate reality little more ive calculated net
hits stolen based number outs made compared what league
average fielder would make same method ive calculated net extra 
bases doubles triples let 

finally i throw all formula i call defensive contribution 
dcon basically represents defensive contribution player
i add number ops get dops defense onbase plus slug which
should represent players total contribution team so dont
take too seriously formula dcon appears end
