 doubtful blue jays would have won al east without morris
last year when team went month august all 
other starters were being shelled milwaukee making charge
morris went pretty good era i cant remember exactly
also lets underestimate importance his innings save 
 bullpen every fifth day he didnt help us win al east forget
about pennent world series

his run support high runs so stottlemyers runs
 he won only games i do remember morris winning inordinate number 
 ballgames his credit he pitched only good
 he needed when he up ballgame he just put cruise
control threw ball up let batters get themseleves out
i hate expression inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying make perfect pitches keep his era down morris being 
veteran pitcher knows winning only thing really matters 
baseball saving himself he able reach back little extra
i hate too when game line

i dont buy all i think things colored very large
degree preconceived notions who players involved try
 exercise

xxx pitching today his team scores first inning 
 fourth xxx gives up st through th fifth
he gives up runs th he gives up more score now
 xxxs team still top

i contend xxx were jack morris assessment would he 
 gutty veteran who pitches only well he has win

 xxx were mike trmbley assessment would he 
inexperienced rookie who doesnt know how pitch needs more
seasoning send him aaa spice rack
