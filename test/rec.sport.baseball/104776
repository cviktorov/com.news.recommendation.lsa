alright thats enough ive suffered all kinds insults 
typical net give me break galarraga currently
batting over you guys complaining he isnt drawing
enough walks what would he have do please you guys bat 
you can hardly claim he hurting his team

fine you willing bet he bat rest way

 point he has hurt rockies so far its he hurt
them eventually just much he hurt expos cardinals 
past couple seasons

 happens pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
 he starts making lots outs someone speculated might happen
 i would agree you he isnt taking enough pitches my comment

 has happened past seasons where have you been

 he isnt paid walk doesnt mean he should have license
 swing bad pitches make outs its more along lines hes
batting leading league rbis so what bloody difference
does make he isnt drawing lot walks sheesh

well see come september i have outstanding bet someone 
galarragas obp less than june 


go california angels
