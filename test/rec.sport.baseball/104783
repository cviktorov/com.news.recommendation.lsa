i hope comes off somewhat unbiased assesment
 wfan wipi go school philadelphia i listen 
both stations consistant basis now fan has mike
lupica from noon have person who can get 
big name guests interviews just local importance
he did have dave cheketts fred wilpon his show he 
had bob costas magic johnson too 
 now here my opinions two stations competing talent
morning show
 my opinion i think imus much better than bruno cataldi 
 morganti even though i would feel different morganti
had better crew people work me wip tries
 copy imus make all sports theme terms 
sports imus lacks blanketing airwaves he
interjects humor politics his show
 am noon
 i think chuck cooperstein lupica equal 
abilities host radio show i think chuck has 
advantage over lupica terms dealing caller
who asking about who local team going draft
 sixth round lupica other hosts fan get
better interview guests i heard pd wip say 
 were interested interviews celebrities unless
 major story
 i would consider even because two different
styles host

 noon pm
 point i would have give big advantage 
jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been
 couple weeks i just think jm has ability
 transcend homer mentality philadelphia fan
base most evident when igglesphiladelphia 
spelling play cowboys because jm huge dallas fan
where else can you have people call up predict 
score without egging hostsrewip morning guys
i do agree jm great fan weekend overnight
 i miss hearing him over current crop rotating
hosts i feel jm best sportstalk host 
either station good margin you ny 
you cant get wip jm does fill weekends sometimes

pm pm
 time when jm goes up against francesa 
russofatso froot loops i become most divided
 my loyalties mike dog very entertaining
 often go hour so without calls even 
 minutes without talking about sports matd do
get great guests basis show so
 like debate another plus 
appearances mike chris imus morning which
 often hilarious 

 pm pm
 matd go up against fredericks missanelli i like
mike missanelli i just cant stomach steve fredericks 
i know sf came from philly originally when he
 fan he ny homer much he philly
homer now i dont listen wip much after pm unless 
 game night you see later 
reason why i give advantage fan

 pm midnight
 sm wip until man who makes
eli calls matd all time seem like novice 
charges racism g cobb man so grating my
nerves i listen him few minutes i go
nutsi know biased listen his show
 fan usually game knicks rangers mets
jets st johns basketball game 
west coast usually howie rose course
i think dead air would better than g cobb wip 
wip does air sixers flyers games during season
 sports station why did lose 
iggles wysphome howard stern phil
during summer 
 all talk wip


overall i would have give advantage wfan 
 exception where even 
 where wip has advantage
