 i have read net last few days i am continually amazed 
pronouncements baseball prowess many individuals especially when 
comes down saying bosox havent prayer long time red sox
fan i simply say impossible dream year those you
 short memories short lives both 

 red sox fan continually subject abuse criticism
from those who only follow hot team statement supported based
 increased number brave woofers out net true fan 
team any team follow team through good years well lean
years amply rewarded when time right 

yeah so what buckner let roller go through his legs who cares 
clemens told cooley go piss up rope promptly earned quick shower 
fact were one best teams league those years fans
supported them now appears lean times number 
detracters come from all over so what let them play we see what 
happens come september red sox may good certainly 
 bad either do have chance win world series after all
remember mets who would have given them chance even make 
far let alone beat baltimore

lets face baseball wonderful game far more unpredictable than football
 basketball because one can never say absolute certainity what
 outcome over course games
