off over last several months threads about rbis 
related topics have gotten me thinking about how well we can 
predict players rbis using information about his overall
performance number runners scoring position risp
 he bats brock model bill james calculated
predicted rbis rbitotal bases home runs 
completely ignores context which all brock 
could do since context unknown so i thought id
take idea starting point look how good fit 
 data you get comparing rbihome runs slgrisp

ive started team data using data from eliass 
ive picked up over years when i could afford them 
b i could stomach thought increasing eliass profits
 gave me years i dont 
have team rbis i could add year you
run simple least squares fit data you get 

rbihome runs slgrisp

 correlation between lhs rhs which 
significant ridiculously high level so i feel like 
fit good team level ive started move 
 player level have looked players clark
ozzie smith joe carter don mattingly i hope 
add quite few more during my copious free time year

 doesnt do too badly except equation underpredicts 
low hr hitter smith which may fault model 
could just ozzie results

 rbihr
 years actual predicted
carter 
clark 
mattly 
smith 

i think we can make case i hope make stronger 
rbis can predicted simply from knowing how player slugs overall
 how many men scoring position when he comes up

more later
