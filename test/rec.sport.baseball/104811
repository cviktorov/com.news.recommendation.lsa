some discussion about whether elias money grubbing deleted

funny seems me stats major league minor league handbooks
which nothing collections statistics authored bill james
 stats inc howe minor league handbook

 i am sure how bill james player ratings book qualifies
 book statistics while elias analyst statistics book
 analyst contains more stats sure also contains more dialogue

finally point about word statistics about
moneygrubbing i dont see how anyone who has looked bill
james player ratings book cannot consider him moneygrubbing

bob vesterman

some thoughts facts

 bill james partial owner stats inc however he has almost
nothing do daytoday operations company although he
does have significant input design books bear his name
 handbook scoreboard best my knowledge 
only things bill actually writes stats predictions section
 handbook bill james fantasy baseball rulebook

 debate over elias goes way back bill james early stuff hampered
 fact elias would give access stats any price
project scoresheet later stats were founded fill void you
can call stats ask them report just about anything 
database provide price course you could
just log online system look data yourself having
attempted pry numbers from elias past football baseball 
just dont do stats eyes high ground comes from making 
information available all

 being said im pretty dissapointed bills book year too
i am given understant mostly response publishers 
desire have book come out sooner than april

hope makes things just little bit clearer

bias alert i am former parttime employee stats
