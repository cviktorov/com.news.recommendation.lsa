tim belcher pitched dandy threehit shutout tonight cincinnati won 
 second straight pittsburgh lefty randy tomlin hit early 
often heavily rightunbalanced reds lineup which managed some
recently rare power bats

belcher solid throughout fact seemed get stronger 
game progressed early he had several threeball counts even those
were few far between later he allowed only one baseonballs while
striking out nine post game interview he said his changeup working
 himi should say so all nine his strikeouts were apparently 
breaking balls

tomlin other hand trouble early giving up secondpitch
double leadoff batter bip roberts bobby kelly followed single 
barry larkin scored roberts sharp single right big guys
mitchell sabo milligan were unable get anything after thatin fact
 all struck outbut kelly managed score anyway due doublesteal
 tomlin wild pitch

 fact appeared tomlin going recover nicely from his shaky
start he retired next batters get fourth behind only
 randy milligan though had different ideas his lineshot 
poorly played orlando merced turned triple milligan would 
later score reggie sanders sacrifice fly giving cinci lead 
after 

 fifth inning spelled loss tomlin when roberts led off his second
double game one batter later larkin smacked double down 
left field line chasing tomlin barry later would score final run 
tom princes twobase passed ball 

 pirates managed only threat day bottom half 
fifth when merced kevin young hit backtoback singles second 
being bunt variety carlos garcia struck out prince fit 
foul fly pinchhitter lonnie smith kd end any pittsburgh hope

pittsburgh pitchers backed tomlin up well though relievers blas minor
