consistent hitter definitely best national league imho 
have williams streaky hitter really clutch hitter batting
th ahead bonds simply injustice giants fans 
giants

 having bonds batting behind williams means matt get
 more good pitches hit important since he struggles
 so much breaking balls opposing pitchers dont want 
 walk williams get bonds


youre definitely correct williams absolutely has sandwiched
 between clark bonds he must i mean must get fastballs 
hitotherwise he becomes little more than sixto lezcano disguise
what i would suggest perhaps batting bonds williams clark
 reason being i feel bonds potential basestealing
abilities wasted when hes stuck behind two slow runners
i think chance getting extra stolen bases bonds 
 spot would more than offset any drop run production having 
clark spot

matt


williams does like hitting cleanup
secondly bonds clark order lot more productive 
runners scoring position than matt i am streaky free swinger williams
