you absolutely correct braves fans nothing bunch 
bandwagoners correct me i am wrong years ago you couldnt give
away ticket see braves playi would bet my next paycheck 
 socalled braves fans living outside georgia present time can 
name more than players from season other hand ask any
cubs fan living anywhere united states name players from any given
year them probably could

you could right again you could wrong claim completely
unverifiable untestable id wager most braves fans net
could name more than players from season

you could give away tickets braves games however my dad i were able
 get great seats from scalper face value which isnt exactly sign
 hot ticket

granted fact team wins brings people ball park 
 does mean diserve title americas team
 only reason considered americas team because ted
turner his little tv station which broadcasts across nation

 precisely why were considered americas team even
especially when were bad you could see most braves games 
cable you could do cubs well braves had better
camerawork better announcers what would you rather listen harry discuss
 game skip pete discuss motoball teams werent too
much worse because tbs braves had lot fans outside georgia
 home kentucky even though we were much closer cincinnati 
 many braves fans reds fans even you could actually watch 
braves play you had go cincinnati watch reds i can go
anywhere america watch braves
 
ill consider toronto americas team before braves

why id guess braves fans more widely distributed than toronto
fans
