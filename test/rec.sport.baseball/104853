you absolutely correct braves fans nothing bunch 
bandwagoners correct me i am wrong years ago you couldnt give
away ticket see braves playi would bet my next paycheck 
 socalled braves fans living outside georgia present time can 
name more than players from season

john smoltz tom glavine german jiminez dale murphy bruce sutter
pete smith rick mahler jim acker jim break through morrison ron
gant andres thomas gerald perry ozzie aeneid virgil lonnie smith
jerry royster
howm i doing so far
note i am braves funn

 other hand ask any
cubs fan living anywhere united states name players from any given
year them probably could

 other hand ii like braves much more than 
cubs all i can name ron santo ernie banks don kessinger
from my favorite cubbie season

granted fact team wins brings people ball park 
 does mean diserve title americas team
 only reason considered americas team because ted
turner his little tv station which broadcasts across nation

right ive watched enough braves games know great deal
 players i like many players only cubs games i
get see while living new york those against mets 
put me sleep because face watching guys like rick sutcliffe 
luis salazar doesnt put me edge my chairu

ill consider toronto americas team before braves

actually i notice lot antitoronto sentiment here 
states partly because some postseries arrogance thanks
 part upsidedown flag dork posts partly because roberto alomar
 about exciting swiss cheese partly because living 
baltimore during winters ive become so fond os fans especially
those who call rex barneys radio show i have side against
 most hated rivals
 
go reds

sorry mets spelled m t
