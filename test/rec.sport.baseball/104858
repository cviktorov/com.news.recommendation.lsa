 heres hard working black players none
 heres lazy white players mcreynolds

now time has passed what would posts like rickey were driving
his boat drunk killing himself one his teammates what would people
say bonds drunk out his skull smashed his car tree disabling
himself say willie mcgee season i can tell you would 
considered spoiled lazy say niggers 

 awfully presumptious you assume you can read our minds 
predict future what makes you so sure i would thinking things
what makes you think theres lot people out dont think
crews god anyone who dead because mistake deserves sympathy 
 crews olin bonds mcgee rickey you mewhy does bother you so 
much two dead white men getting little sympathy would make you 
feel better we only mourned dead black baseball players

 beat dead horse i seem remember fair amount sympathy 
some black fringe player named roberto clemente roy 
campanella thurman munson just about anyone else 
who we may even have liked players mourned dying too young

wiggins alan

 thats besides point im sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic rickey he were killed would also 
criticizing him lot more his actions

example 

how about jose canseco he gets couple speeding tickets all
 sudden his attitude awful what hell do speeding tickets
have do clubhouse influence anyway so why do sportswriters
talk about all time

 brian hunter keith mitchell both whom had dwi problems
towards end last year two years ago cited sign
 immaturity etc 

meanwhile dykstra almost killed both himself daulton i didnt
read any sportswriter complaining about may have talked
about how bad phillies i never read anywhere
criticism dykstras character daultons intelligence 
matter based incident
