 black players cant survive being mediocre worse how can mcrae
 chamberlain explained

nobodys saying its hard fast rule my point white 
players likely stick around longer theyre mediocre

i went through tb iii made list year b who were 
negative both adjusted batting runs total player rating tpr
has some problems its generally too far off career
imho all players who played most career after were 
considered

here through i havent done rest yet

armas bailor balboni bannister beauchamp beniquez bergman berry
biittner blair bochte bonnell bosley bradford l brown buckner
cabell ccastillo cater cimoli cline clines coles d collins
davalillo dernier dilone gaston geiger geronimo gosger heep
iorg

 few black players lot white hispanic

hmmmone questionhow do you differentiate hispanic black
after all some people fall both categoriesrafael ramiriez
comes mindand hed fit grouping also
oopshes ofbalthough he lighthitting
utility player sorry about miguel dilone would
qualify i remember correctly

when i say black i mean usborn black people purposes 
discussion hispanic players were baseball before one 
team s signed lots hispanics because went over better
 local audience than blacks did 

 why would more hispanics stick around than blacks

dont know remember country had special racial
laws one group one group only blacks our national history 
includes huge longterm global tensions regarding black minority 
 hispanic minority while often discriminated against has never been
 object national obsession

 might also worth your while subdivide data careers
starting year intervals i would think your prediction
would most true careers starting s least true
 careers starting s course youd also have 
compare total ml racial percentages era question

absolutely i said before i expect effect disappearing
 certainly did exist all out talk twgs all 
 without some small reason

im opinion your point less valid today than 
 years ago i would curious see data

well theres list go ill cull some more names i go
i expect youre right btw
