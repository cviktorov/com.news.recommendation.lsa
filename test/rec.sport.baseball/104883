o any you experts want analyze ron gant

omeone sure needs analyze him gant head case his what six 
seven years majors hes put together combined total maybe one
good season he lacks selfconfidence worse he doesnt really
understand baseball curiously he seems perform best when his job
 threatened sit him down game he might get hit next
night let him play what he thinking about getting hits
driving runs hes worried hes going get stolen
bases th career home run he appears have learning curve
he never figured out how play third base what fiasco he still
plays outfield his legs hes lucky hes so fast because enables
him outrun his mistakes i suggested earlier season 
looks me like hes slowing down little bit else every groundskeeper
 watering infield dirt little extra

gant has had way too much chance already he may get hot again 
 couple months hell always revert his true level

gants ml record age season

year g ab ba obp slg hr sb cs
 
 rd base expt year
 
 
 
 

 majors parts seasons total playing time
approx seasons

just looking his hitting record hes had seasons ops
greater than which pretty good his
 season pretty decent rookie b move 
third base explains lot his when he returned 
he began hitting again course last year he slumped

 learning curve he has obviously improved his batting eye
over years well his sbcs ratio his fielding
he infielder when he drafted bman he came
up through braves system braves put him through
 position changes space year hes adequate 
although great least some your perception his
fielding colored watching him learn play 
ml level i know youre another longterm braves fan 

about playing bimo thats nd most difficult position
 field after catcher ss b you need more range 
speed b youve got have quick reflexes have 
 gun arm second chances b even when
playing sandlot softball granted id still put my best
overall infielder ss thats because he gets more
chances because job harder still amazes me
 so many teams have tried convert other position players
 b maybe thats because supply natural b 
scarce

finally gant player who puts pressure himself 
perform well works hard improve you dont get
those amazingly huge arms relatively small body without 
lot weight work now whether hes been overdoing 
days may valid question question whether
he tries too hard make something happen during each atbat
 frankly player going live up potential
id much rather fail trying too hard than 
trying hard enough you might able teach relaxation
 adult age i dont believe you can teach
hustle

all said i dont think id sign gant another longterm
contract hes now i think hes freeagent eligible
 years when hell given his career curve 
limitations i wouldnt expect him last much past 
 ml ballplayer he might surprise me here atlantas
got some talent farm id rather take my chances
down road nieves et al
