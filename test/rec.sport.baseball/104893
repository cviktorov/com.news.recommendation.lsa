 true note i dont think lasorda should 
fired least two reasons

 publicly humiliating his players
 knuckling under his players wishes

 fine line between getting players input knuckling
under players demands manager much like military officer
needs have his her players complete obedience respect during
 game after game its big deal when time 
 do more than react players must trust manager team often
falls apart see boston red sox ff 

strawberrys demeanor represented media often sounds like
demands i suspect comment like i enjoy hitting fourth im
used would get pretty brutally misinterpreted media 
 came from strawberry russ porter quoted strawberry saying
i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup i think i perform best
 role paraphrased my memory bias seems like
 fairly nonpetulant answer what almost certainly question 
like how do you feel about being moved third spot order
 more mediasensitive player might answer manager knows what he 
doing he thinks batting me third help team i
am all wed ignore answer brown stuff so seems 
little bit overreaction brand darryls response petulant

personally i think his argument nonsense really doesnt
matter much which order players order batted
except personal stats i were darryl id probably answer 
question number four spot gets few more rbi opportunities i get
paid rbis i think best me bat fourth i am willing
 hit third tommy thinks benefit team something like
 would helpful salary timemy rbis were down because i 
hitting thirdand make him sound like team player since strawberry
 likely go through arbitration use free agent market 
his next contract maybe argument useless would help 
his image media without appearing totally contentfree

remember media belief ones best rbi man should hit
fourth so argument sensible regardless whether 
true
