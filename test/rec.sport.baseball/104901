 fascinating you say alomar better hitter last 
year immediately follow up numbers showing baerga
had better year only category i see which shows advantage
 alomar obp

well obp most important offensive statistic big margin
 points obp worth considerably more than points slugging
 being said i still think baerga very slightly better last year
 i think close wash youre likely find

i personally dont care much alomars defense i dont think hes
nearly good people make him out he cant turn dp
 save his life he comes across bag improperly his release
 slow considering high leverage dp shortcoming
i cant overlook long term id move alomar another position

 jays could trade hot devon white something ill alomar
could hell cf long run i think id rather have jeff
kent b alomar cf than alomarwhite

 available thru id happy turn up you i didnt
