 media beating incident dodger stadium wednesday 
 death i havent seen anything rsb yet
 
 gerald perry cardinals pinch hit eighth inning two
 his club down run he stroked line drive 
 right field corner ball cleared threefoot high fence 
 went crowd darryl racing over from right center got 
 spot time reach his glove up over short fence he
 missed ball fan sitting front row wearing mitt
 reached up caught ball home run
 
 now ive seen replay several times i have concluded 
 darryl missed ball fans glove essentially
 behind darryls several dodger fans seats immediate
 vicinity have claimed fan unquestionably interfered 
 strawberry what cannot disputed however fan
 who caught ball never took his eye off he oblivious
 where fielder playing he also quite exuberant 
 soon he realized he had made catch
 
 stuff about daryl tommy everyone blaming fan loss deleted

i saw replay several times too question about daryl missed
 ball fan caught daryl so tall he had 
first shot ball daryls just whining again i think shows 
lack class when tommy daryl dodgers blame single fan 
losing game what about pitcher who threw up gopher ball
what about pitchers gave up runs up point sorry tommy
 were game daryl feet inches tall maybe 
just maybe youd have argument
