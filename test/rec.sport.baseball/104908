 astros relief corps holding together doug jones keeps his changeup
 effective xavier hernandez can effective its passable
 theres reasonable lefthanded help middle relief iffy
 tom edens expected take over joe boever setup man role 
 hes been injured he expansion team acquisition anyway 
 houston thought boever would demand too much money so let him
 go doug jones can lose his touch he went from clevelands allstar
 closer minors pretty short span

 from what i understand boever murphy were considered expendable 
 
club houston felt positions could filled number 
players art doug jones key houstons success he must have
another great year houston challenge nl west 
 argument all murphy he scared hell out me when he came 
last year other hand club though enough boever put him 
 awful lot games he may have led league appearances he did 
least some point he seemed very viable setup guy i guess
thats considered crucial club i can just remember two years
ago so well though

 unsuspected strength lower part order has saved 
 club so far biggio finley just arent doing job getting
 base instead filling his role rbi man bagwell has had 
 assume biggio finleys job biggio concerns me since he usually
 starts season very strong

im concerned those guys have been relatively consistent over 
years have good reasons decline injuries old 
i expect them come through just fine its those guys have 
been consistently good worrisome part even coming
through right now
 

 side note you all concerned rumors concerning
next years uniform talk road uniform 
blech traditional grey word houston written across 
chest im mistaken home uniforms may totally eliminate
 color orange shiver mclanes favorite color red so

 sounds like old road unis pretty dull buttons pullovers
ill check through my uniform book see theyve always had some orange

 im really upset current unforms dull new ones sound
horrible id like see uniform mids return 
may have been pretty houston had established long precident 
wearing ugliest uniforms baseball i liked 

well well see ive got astros pullover shirt astros stripes
across shoulders i have trouble making myself wear public i
can see why might want change gee eliminate 
orange reupholster seats astros stripes section what
used gold yellow levels i dont know those numbers use
now

i saw pinstripe version astros cap i actually thought looked 
good
