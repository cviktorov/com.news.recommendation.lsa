ive been giants season ticket holder years never really complained
about old ballyard place sure its been cold food lines were long
 hired hands were surly all part giants mystique
 so i thought

i went tuesdays game giants over marlins stick 
 much different place nothing short dome eliminate wind 
everything lot better lines lot shorter bathrooms 
clean have running water hired hands were very polite 

 new foghorn lights up blows after each homerun wooden fence
 very nice new bleachers bleachers start right top
 fence give great view theyve got beer stands 
bottome bleachers only complaint electronic 
oldfashioned scoreboard looks electronic could better

 things should have been done long time ago took real 
businessman ex safeway president peter magowan figure out just 
like he used tell his checkers customers dont come back i dont
need many checkers isnt knock bob lurie he competent
businessman he didnt deal much general public

ill give example how level service has changed onion 
dispenser jammed i using attendant came over apoligized 
 problem proceeded fix machine after he done he cleaned
 machine said he glad able help old days 
 attendant folks concession stands would say go 
 stand feet away might able help

all all fun day
