which reminds me yet again bucscards game whitey herzogs
last year cards manager karen i were watching game tv
 some barely explicable reason camera kept dwelling 
white rhino himself his uniformfilling worst truly horrible

do you remember game nlcs after dodgers defeated
 mets ughadugh fooboo fat stomach tom lasorda came running out
 field celebration yuck
he undulated his arms flew up down keeping time his
rolling set stomachs which flew all around cozy confines 
chavez ravine he oozed like white gastropod he ran 
disgusting sight only couldnt i watch my mets series i had
 watch fat stomach lasorda roll around dodger
blargh

 what made memorable what karen eventually said about 
which 

i would rather sleep jar bill landrums spit under my pillow
 than look whitey herzog one those uniforms

 you like short fat men who grunt curse spit lot
whiteys certainly your man former wfan host pete franklin white
rat 
 its true emphasis appearance ballplayers 
tight uniforms only works player actually has extraodinary 
physique looking charlie houghs scrawny torso through those tight
white shirts just sort makes me decide hmmm i dont want eat lunch
todayor tomorrowor anytime soon
when al harazin first became mets gm he asked he intended

sides uniforms he said hes very much favor keeping them
