some evidence working

take look standings its real easy get so focussed 
minutinae forget giants happen first place its
working you dont screw up changing things just because you think 
ought different

some folks like argue about theoretical details i prefer watch teams
win when giants slip third we can talk about how rearrange
 batting order until i think its stupid focus whats wrong
 simple fact its working 

ps does mailing list maintainer think clark best 
first baseman majors matt williams better power hitter
than any other ballplayer

 majors i dont follow al so i wont comment majors nl
 i had my choice any b league my team itd clark 
id hit him third my fantasy team has both grace murray because
ive never been able get clark id take any three without
hesitation real life i think clark 

williams even close i much prefer his defense when he isnt
headcasing matt has good solid swing some real punch he drops
 he wanders out cleanup according latest
baseball weekly hes hitting last week hitting 
thats exactly chopped liver

mostly though giants winning frankly long 
continues its rather silly secondguess strategy evidently
some folks would rather right than first
