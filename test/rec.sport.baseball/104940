i think sac flies only way obp can below ba


does seem dumb anyone else
 fact comment

why should batters obp hurt sac fly especially sac
bunts dont have same effect since do same thing
 sac flies usually score run while bunts just advance base

 both situations involve batter giving up ab 
 benefit team sacrifice so why should hurt 
stats

 sac bunt purposeful act ordered manager 
 batter does go up trying get sac fly 
evidence available indicates ability 
players cant themselves hit sac flies fly out
 same place just often when theres nobody third

sorry i gotta disagree here last time i played ball i went up 
several occasions intending hit fly ball deep enough score 
runner from third advance runner third its relatively easy
actually you swing under path ball you normally would 
hit good line drive fastballs its very easy much more
difficult good breaking balls good hitter excellent bat
control can voluntarily hit fly balls outfield least oh 
 time

you havent been facing major league pitching 

 maybe more you have good plate most
 those guys just likely opt getting base hit 
helping average getting sacrifice best example i know
 jerry willard series against minnesota all he had 
do put one game over he swung waaaaaay past
parallel accomplished barely getting run safely

stats did little study scoreboard book entitled can
you hit sacrifice flies purpose summary findings

over year period sacfly type fly balls were produced 
percent time situations where sac fly useful 
 percent time when sac fly wasnt useful

 looked leaders sac flies found leaders
 sac flies other words guys you would expect good
 hit sac fly type fly balls only more often when 
needed difference way too small result skill
essentially players who hit lot sac flies seem do
so because hit hit sac fly type flies often without
 runner third

stats concludes so appears conclusive hitters cannot hit
sacrifice flies purpose even practice batting
cage
