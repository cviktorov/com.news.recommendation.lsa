 just watch me mattingly below average fielder 

 before you start up yes i have proof really only two
 adequate ways measure fielding prowess first which has 
 advantage being applicable older players since uses raw data
 available almost all mlb history total chances per game
 method favored total baseball people among others basically
 says you measure fielder how many balls he gets 

 subject all kinds bias almost completely useless
 first basemen from raw stats way tell which 
 first basemans putouts were made throws from other fielders 
which were made his own plays likewise you cant tell whether 
double play fielding runs thus gives first
baseman credit putouts double plays only assists 
errors 

 thus favors first basemen who play deep reaching lot balls 
forcing pitcher cover first more frequently also hurts first
baseman who play behind lefthanded pitching staffs thus face few
lefthanded batters

 better method newer based ondata has only been collected
 over last few years measures percentage balls hit 
 part field guy responsible 

 better course still isnt all first basemans
defense

 some references mattinglys defensive rating stats method from
 mike gimbels baseball player team ratings 

defensive average which uses larger probably better zones has
mattingly tied second league

 other hand he has contributed runs his batting
 actions pretty healthy number 

while batting runs good mostly past runs he
produced dont say much about his value
