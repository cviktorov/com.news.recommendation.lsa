 game saw little everythingincredible defense some power
clutch pitching little wildnessthe reds managed overcome 
trademark lack timely hitting crucial situations

 during spring training i made similarly innoncentlooking comment 
 about clutch hitting bb flames were flying 
 thing clutch hitting sdcns all screamed i assumed
 also meant thing any kind clutch performance
 given comments 

 certainly case significant ability toi
perform clutch clutch performance certainly happens every
time gamewinning hit clutch pitching quoted above 
something which happened claim any particular player should
 expected clutch pitcher

 over past four seasons sabo has had hits abs defined 
 clutch situations scouting report average 
 over same period he had another abs hits 
 average 

 according rest sdcns any differential 
 completely totally random cannot used any reasonable
 inference perhaps perez should have used pinch hitter 
 situation

simple statistics tell me chance average clutch
hitter would have large split average decrease points
standard deviation about hitters any league
just hitters who hit poorly tuesdays

 only very weak correlation my best study between
clutch hitting last four years clutch hitting year
probably because most clutch data determinaed luck rather
than any ability based only data i dont see any reason 
pinchhit sabo any other player who had been poor clutch
hitter past

 many other factors involved decision pinchhit
does pinchhitter give you platoon advantage any portion 
sabos clutch split results from his platoon split certainly 
real ability even has nothing do clutch hitting do you
have singles hitter plate when you need home run do you
have curveball pitcher facing batter who has trouble curves
