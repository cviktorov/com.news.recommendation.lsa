sigh here we go again 

actually several scdns stated were definable skills
 would make hitter more likely perform better clutch
situations vs nonclutch situations however one might choose 
define clutch

right can you define skill

must i i were say batting average predictor 
can used judge which two hitters more likely get 
hit particular plate appearance only valid i can
define skill hitting baseball thats all ive said 
except i used smaller sample batting average clutch situations

 elsewhere thread sherri nichols repeats her position
 batting average clutch situations meaningless statistic

 predicting future has been entirely meaningless least
 has meaning we dont know how find 

i did say i could predict future ive suggested 
statistic necessarily meaningless heres data 
situation

nonclutchclutch 
abhbaabhba

sabo
samuel


 you were have been reds manager time i assume you
would have had some basis letting sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting samuel im sure some basis would have utilized
prior performance you just wouldnt have used particular
aspect prior performance correct


ill try avoid being insulting its difficult when you so
cavalierly dismiss hundreds hours work i dont pretend
 understand 

nobody denying people who have hit well 
clutch past i challenge you find method predict
who hit well clutch future which after all 
what you claiming you can do since


one more time i did claim able predict future
i said i accept above data indication samuel would
have had better chance success situation than sabo

 i am dismissing your work im stating my opinion
you saying your work renders any opinion contrary
invalid so retention opinion some kind insult
 your work


fine we have plenty data obviously our preconceived biases must
 coloring our work since you know clutch hitting 
welldefined consistent skill all our failures
notwithstanding so i challenge you prove i guarantee you
 you can prove existance some form clutch ability
you have plenty happy sdcns dancing around you

i did say clutchhitting well defined

i said data significant me

i did say consistent skill

i have said indicator performance under 
certain set circumstances


 you arent going win any support merely stating position
 claiming stupid so i must right


 big sigh


i have 

 
 
 
 
 ever called you anyone else rsb stupid


 nice however see you consider possibility
 you actually could have some preconceived biases


yeah hindsight always doesnt make you bright 
 stupid argument you know 

ah i knew we could get name calling theres word
you like so much


 suggestion take data from attempt come up 
some method predicts who hit well clutch 
works we can attempt apply beyond

wait minute i thought i first had define clutch hitting
do i dont i

you have made strong statements now back them up proven 
total idiot

i made two statements my post

i am convinced your conclusions regarding clutch hitting

i would have hit sabo


 many us make number written statements through 
 media about what we think happen baseball im 
shy about ill make statement again i believe 
seasons end chris sabos batting average clutch situations
 significantly lower than his batting average nonclutch
situations i cant prove happen so i guess well 
just have wait see


 
heres another one you joe carters batting
average clutch situations significantly below his batting
average nonclutch situations each year i presume you think
 random 

nonclutch ab h
clutch ab h

so what could we expect from mr carter

well his composite ba through through 
 through so i think we have pretty good
idea what kind batting average he can produce 
he hit surprising huh also 

nonclutch ab h
clutch ab h

 doesnt prove any overall statistical trend can
 used predict future performance across breadth 
major league ballplayers just makes me think 
joe carters batting average clutch going 
 high his ba nonclutch situations
 
 
 above i have plenty company john dewan statsinc 
 editor scouting report wherein statistics regarding
clutch hitting compiled reported referenced text
bill james makes numerous references players ability hit
well clutch i am saying i can predict future
any more than you others saying your
work renders statements mine meaningless i dont 
accept which your words proves i am total idiot


stupid total idiot 

my my hostility
