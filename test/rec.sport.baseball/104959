like clinton reno i accept full responsibility 
senseless disaster my wife i picked game go 
 thus caused return preseasonprojected sox
offense like all nonos bosio good lucky hard grounder
 vaughn off t martinez glove straight boone who 
threw bosio first backed good defense
many nontrivial groundouts game amazingly fast
 sox tended go down quickly hesketh also 
working fast sox relief pitching ok runs off
quantrill were two ridiculous bloops hard line single
which greenwell let get past him trying catch

greenwells mental stability serious concern i guess 
has always been his quirks were amusing back when he 
 mvp candidate wednesday he got huff johnson 
after striking out bad inside pitch apparently johnson
made ok ive got stay focused gesture which iron mike
interpreted taunting struck out heavy booing 
next two times valentine noted last night he came up 
 first after riles quintana had walked open game
can you say take first pitch mike who dribbled 
 pi quoted bosio batting
practice fastball next time up he also hit first pitch
 hard liner straight kgjr center he also made 
pathetic error failed catch boones hr which looked 
comparable ball lance johnson caught highlight
reel night

 riles suppsoed good defensively i couldnt tell from
 field angle his range looked bad he coughed dp
 cost run two why he leadoff i hope fletcher
gets well soon

also lineups pinella put bret boone fifth reasons beyond
me seemed work he hr some good
defense wag behind us said he sure dont want go back 
calgary theory you put leadoff type fifth
because theyll likely lead off second boone did

well now we face hot angels another power pitcher 
langston reminder contest entries open through next
wednesday i expect surge pessimism way ties 
 broken earliest entry one entry per person pseudonym
please easy pseudonyms
