 i dont pretend understand
statistical analysis

well we agree last part 

cool thank you intelligent response devoid silly
namecalling others 


 one basic things you need 
have statistic able predict players performance 
 future correlation from year year 
players batting average correlated fairly well from year year

ok

 basic problems something like clutch batting average overall
batting average correlation from year year almost zero 
adding sample size doesnt seem help much

actually i think largescale sample size part problem
 seems me we were plot all players baseball
 regard ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind 
bell curve xaxis being deviation clutch hitting
vs nonclutch yaxis being number players certainly
 would some players extreme ends bell my
supposition we were find same players consistently
year after year one end bell other we might
 able make some reasonable conclusions about those players
 opposed all baseball players

 counterexample 
what you showed consider following two players from 

 nonclutch clutch
 ab h ba ab h ba
 
maldonado 
lemon 

 you had had two players your logic those clutch
situations youd bat maldonado lemon blink eye well 
 maldonado hit nonclutch clutch while lemon
hit nonclutch clutch before you accuse me 
completely cooking data

you wont hear those kind accusations from me interesting
 you selected maldonado because he someone whom i have also 
looked he has been very inconsistent hitter terms ba
hitting admittedly he has
been traded between leagues well clubs his clutch hitting 
record equally inconsistent so my purposes i would
 draw any conclusions about his ability hit clutch based
 his prior performance i dont know how i would have felt 
 you may indeed right 

when i looked sabo i found more consistent record hitting 
 more consistent pattern his clutch hitting being proportionately
below his nonclutch ba ditto joe carter

 probably brings us heart disagreement i am having
 others topic must any conclusion based statistical
history able applied broadly throughout data base before
 has any validity impossible irrational apply
statistical analysis selected components data base


btw correlating players overall batting average from 
 gives correlation coefficient which significant 
something better than confidence level correlating 
clutchnonclutch ba same period gives correlation 
 significant level any interest

i completely accept reasoning again what we were find
 same individuals each end spectrum consistent
basis 

actually its technically incorrect say we cant predict future
clutch performance its more correct say we cant predict
future clutch performance any skill

amen
