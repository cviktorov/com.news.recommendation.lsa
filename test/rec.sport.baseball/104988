actually i think largescale sample size part problem
 seems me we were plot all players baseball
 regard ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind 
bell curve xaxis being deviation clutch hitting
vs nonclutch yaxis being number players certainly
 would some players extreme ends bell

right most definitely

my supposition we were find same players
consistently year after year one end bell other
 we might able make some reasonable conclusions about
those players opposed all baseball players

 may root confusion

please consider following hypothetical open mind note
 i am yet saying has anything do 
question hand

suppose we have simplified lotto game you pick number from 
 win number drawn suppose we have large population
 people who play game every week

 first year game approximately population
 win more times

 second year game those time winners again
 time winners

 third year game those who won more times 
each first two years win again

suppose i started people my population after three
years i have people who have consistently each last
three years won more number times expected

do we expect them big winners fourth year game
 because we know skill involved nothing about 
consistent winners can influence chances winning 
suppose we dont know whether chance skill
might involved perhaps some people our population 
psychic something how would we test hypothesis

we can look correlations population now most 
population show zero correlation our psychics should show 
high positive correlation even arent very good psychics
 should still manage win more times most years net
result small positive correlation over entire population

 probably brings us heart disagreement i am having
 others topic must any conclusion based statistical
history able applied broadly throughout data base before
 has any validity impossible irrational apply
statistical analysis selected components data base

well zero correlation zero correlation you mention sabo has
hit poorly clutch over last years we look 
 past we find clutch patterns just likely reverse
 remain consistent length streak doesnt
seem make difference probability player 
clutch choke next year any reason expect 
streak different from past streaks

now were true all threeyear streaks remained true
 form we might have something useful we wouldnt
have zero correlation instead we have all threeyear streaks
remain true form all threeyear streaks reverse you
look those numbers say three year choke streak implies more
likely choke year would equally valid look 
those numbers say three year choke streak implies more likely 
 clutch year since probabilities split each
way

i completely accept reasoning again what we were find
 same individuals each end spectrum consistent
basis 

 we would have something useful we would also have 
positive correlation every individual exhibits 
pattern holds true another who exhibits pattern
 reverses

cheers
