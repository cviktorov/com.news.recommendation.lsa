actually i think largescale sample size part problem
 seems me we were plot all players baseball
 regard ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind 
bell curve xaxis being deviation clutch hitting
vs nonclutch yaxis being number players certainly
 would some players extreme ends bell my
supposition we were find same players consistently
year after year one end bell other we might
 able make some reasonable conclusions about those players
 opposed all baseball players

lets careful here players performance completely random
 clutchno clutch you would still expect some players 
good clutch every year some notsogood every year
 two years worth data youd have players good each
year bad each year would have one good one bad year
we have players years just flipping coin youd
expect players good all years bad every year
 what we actually get

 good years 
clutch performers 
coin flip random 

essentially distribution clutch performers number years
 good performance same what you would get process
leading deviations from nonclutch performance completely random
 anything clutch hitting least definition
 had any predictive capability you expect see number 
players ends much larger than predicted flipping
 coin further you limit yourself players who were lot above
 below average clutch situations say standard deviation from 
 mean more than one year random explanation still looks good
 four years i looked data from elias 
were players minimum bats clutch 
situations were sigma from mean two different years 
those players them changed sign between two
years other words were great clutch hitters one year 
really horrible other year just random process 
youd expect those numbers 

everything thats been measured about clutch hitting over period
 years could used predict any ability any 
proposed definition has looked like random process 
caveat may something related platoon advantage
 could dragged out dataeg john lowenstein 
probably never had clutch ab against lefthanded pitcher
 he might well have had some blowouts so would
 bias since his clutch abs would more geared his 
platoon advantage subject has been glanced
 casually lot people have put lot effort 
studying every one them exception 
elias study has been unable find anything would allow
you predict how someone do clutch situations better
than flipping coin selfserving plug follows some 
flaws elias study discussed my paper forth
coming sabr book perfect game taylor publishing 
authors supposed get slice advance so go bug
your local bookstores now maybe i can get enough take my
wife dinner once
