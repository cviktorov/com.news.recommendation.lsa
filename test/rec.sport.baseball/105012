ive been following giants closely over offseason newspapers
notesgroup etc i had my first up close personal last night 
 stick

after watching giants hitters struggle last year barrys swing 
very impressive hes very quick his swing seems effortless even
compared clark particularly clark late

 interesting see bonds hit maddux so well im sure 
barry after revenge against braves what he stroked
three very pretty hits b b hr rbis

 giants always hit maddux well interesting maddux
did pitch around bonds get clayton last night he threw straight
fastballs over plate bonds st last night got away 
first one bonds hit second one out park rd
when clark third base one out maddux did intentionally
walk bonds bonds dropped single leftcenter


 giants team doing lot surprising things year 
addition bonds has been some good pitching some hitters
seem swinging much better claytons defense has been superb
mcgee seems like leading off year manwaring driving ball
so so forth

 braves announcers pointed out mcgee leadoff hitter has
 scored run yet he always hit around im concerning
about his onbase percentage key lineup matt williams he
has stay hot so bonds can hit runners base


i hope continuesi think need continue well june before
people really sold realparticularly pitching

 pitching gets set back bud black placed dl burba
has done superb job filling so far he looks like different pitcher
from last year however swift terrible both his starts 
burba moving rotation mike jackson only righthanded
reliever aside from rod beck hell get lot actions i also hope 
dusty can manage his bullpen better than roger craig especially beck
i concerned when beck used straight days earlier week


 myself i think fresh start magowanbakeretc has really wiped
out lot negatives from last few years real factor
 helping them significantly improve over last year

 so far so good
