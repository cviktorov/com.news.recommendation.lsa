 very interesting gehrig below bonds schmidt ricky henderson 
 he 
 could steal bases his hitting stats even close 
 dimmagios
 uhhhh where winfield
 
 hendersons stats probably closer dimaggios than you
 think
 
 give me numbers man
 
 winfield could whip hendersons butt
 
 what 
 
 basestealing hendersons alltime leader good about
 runs worth sb lifetime winfield about sb behind 
 has net runs
 
 onbase average winfields best year nine points
 below hendersons lifetime oba lifetime diff points
 
 slugging winfield points 
 
 theyre both good ofs though winfield looks better his huge
 bod
 
 winfields best year henderson 

 tb iii gives henderson total player rating winfield 
 have rickey much better fielder which i dont buy 
 henderson simply best leadoff hitter all time winfield
 isnt best anything all time



henderson best leadoff hitter alltime arguably winfield has 
meant more his team than henderson unlike daryll henderson tries 
hard he amazing centerfielder rickey very good maybe better 
than winfield i angry dissing winfield though winfield has 
been better than henderson lately check numbers winfield may 
surprise you he have basehits should have homeruns 
when he retireswishful thiniking he plays
