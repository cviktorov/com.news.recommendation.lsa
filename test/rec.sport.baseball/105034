quoted future reference
shown consistent past overall performance lr splits
even matching hittingpitching styles all give me some
advantage used properly

 predicting future next ab he predicting 
sabo more likely get hit than samuel

he believed one two things sabo more likely than samuel
 get hit more good would done long run
 leaving sabo regardless expectation actual outcome

 fact you dont know what perez had mind when he left sabo 

 supporting swap you predicting opposite

 fact i dont think anyone claiming can predict
 future any particular future event we can believe
 certain trends due cause whether we have
identified cause therefore continue

 i am dismissing your work im stating my opinion
you saying your work renders any opinion contrary
invalid so retention opinion some kind insult
 your work
well yes you aware its existance you claim incapable
 understanding though i suspect you simply unwilling yet
you rather forcefully state opposite you dont seem think 
work worth reading yet you obviously feel topic important
id say insulting

i think seeing insults other peoples opinions kind silly
after all mark didnt call you total idiot call your work
stupid he simply stated didnt change his opinion 
subject

i did say consistent skill
i have said indicator performance under 
certain set circumstances
right beef has proven indicator 
future performance under any circumstances least none 
weve been able come up you know some where 
indicator future performance please let us your secret

 player hits better tuesdays always has mark believes
 might indication he hit tuesday better next
season well would you respond same way some point you
might admit all variable might known you who knows
what guy does every monday night maybe he sees his sports
shrink tuesday mornings has his vitamin b shots monday nights

 something thats true one guy only doesnt
mean meaningful correlation entire
league days week nor should doesnt
mean we cant make predictions based particular
player

i believe 
seasons end chris sabos batting average clutch situations
 significantly lower than his batting average nonclutch
situations i cant prove happen so i guess well 
just have wait see

 simply prediction chris sabo year 
 prediction all batters who have over past few years hit
xxx amount worse clutch than overall

i only see prediction one player here i dont see anything
about all batters

heres another one you joe carters batting
average clutch situations significantly below his batting
average nonclutch situations each year i presume you think
 random 
im going get case analysis sure you can find somebody
who hit poorly from hit poorly well you
can also find those who hit poorly from hit well 


thats exactly what mark trying do though find hitters
 have correlation ask whether we can make predictions
 hitters based past performance

major league ballplayers just makes me think 
joe carters batting average clutch going 
 high his ba nonclutch situations
gamblers fallacy unless reason expect consistency 

huh what does gamblers fallacy have do anything
whether you can know reason correlation you cant
deny has existent you can only make argument 
you dont think likely continue exist because you
cant see reason exist

run proves nothing can you give us reason expect clutch ba 
correlate from one year next ive seen detailed study 

someone posted recently why negative clutch would correlate
 argument along lines star player lr splits 
always see adverse condition late innings close game
ie opposing manager always bring ah pitcher 
face him where his manager pull him ph

i dont see how you can deny total idiot yes you
prove yourself unwilling even consider evidence might
suggest you wrong i would say term fits nicely
so tell me does term fit do you have open mind

what about you shoe fits you wear open mind
