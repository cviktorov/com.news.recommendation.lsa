also i have impression from reading group bill james
 elias bunch moneygrubbing jerks whose mission 
charge much can baseball statistical info


 bill james yeah sure do you own bill james players
rating book

uh bill james doesnt sell statistics he sells books statistics
 he business providing stats like elias stats
howe baseball workshop etc 

greg

funny seems me stats major league minor league handbooks
which nothing collections statistics authored bill james
 stats inc howe minor league handbook

 i am sure how bill james player ratings book qualifies
 book statistics while elias analyst statistics book
 analyst contains more stats sure also contains more dialogue

finally point about word statistics about
moneygrubbing i dont see how anyone who has looked bill
james player ratings book cannot consider him moneygrubbing
