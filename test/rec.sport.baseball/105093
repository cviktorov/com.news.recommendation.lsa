perhaps you can give more recent citation any player mentioned 
malingerer thanks

i guess i dont understand your question i trying imply 
 accusations glenn davis malingering were certainly played
up very much 

still whispers reached san francisco certainly possible 
were stronger elsewhere also teammates making aspersions any
event i know other player maligned last couple years

 any case i believe mike lavalliere has been accused poor
work habits general sloth recently probably malingering
just he being released its interesting nobody heard
much about problems before were so important

i have heard sanders called many things well i have heard him called
lazy given sport phenomenon would difficult label him 


exactly so which means his media detractors have had say other
things about him i believe its general phenomenon writers
dont like you theyll find label stick matter who you
 i find myself more interested selection labels than 
why writers feel need act way fascinates
me much either

uh original authors point black white players were por
trayed differently media towards he gave highly selected
list prove his case sanders name showed up eventually i dispute 
sanders has ever been called lazy media 

hmm big ego possible club house disturbance etc good press

 isnt total extent press he received 
pittsburgh where he called all kinds things including lazy 
spoiled local columnists again actual words used may
shift around time expediency lazy tends higher
 list nonwhite players least my subjective opinion

aside might interesting somebody do archival study
 player descriptions before after color barrier broken
 teams like red sox which have been traditionally white
nowadays most people think carl yastrzemski one those
bluecollar hardworking guys early s he often
portrayed lazy bum really

hmm i never heard anyone accuse canseco being lazy nor sierra

ive heard accusations canseco bad fielder could 
great one he put his mind ignoring whether he 

actually dave stewart one most vocal about any 
event lazy

 least one poster last week has fired off major screed 
cansecoislazy issue so i think your point best quibble 
probably weaker than 

uh poster specifically stated allow me first 
quibble state media did portray canseco being 
lazy other person chooses so accuse him after my post does 
make quibble fact media around here tended play up his
time wieght room hardly lazy hardly quibble have you ever
seen any mediot portray canseco lazy unconcerned his fielding yes
lazy 

bad fielder i think still interesting matter i
think cansecos colorful offfield antics get lots more national
attention than those say roger clemens

well hes had few more them

 least more youve heard about i think one questions
here surrounds selective reporting having said i have say
 selective reporting hypothesis has potential 
unfalsifiable least those us who arent reporters police
 private investigators

well canseco has been involved several felonies including his highspeed
record carrying concealed firearms course domestic violence 
clemens had runin bar canseco had well both cases 
coverage relatively minimal

puckett stewart jackson 

i said overrepresent nonwhites three anecdotal data points dont
make interesting counterargument btwwhich jackson we talking
about here reggie bo darrin danny 

uh only evidence offered anecdotal how can objected 
counter also anecdotal

 seems like everybody who has ever won batting title among
others has been accused some time caring more his own
stats than good team also seems me youre

kirby puckett i have never heard accusation made puckett i 
have heard boggs actually i believe him thats another 
matter

 living minnesota i cant say whether line has ever
been used against kirby far boggs goes im sure why
you bring him up since hes one obvious prototypes line
i quoted along ted williams rod carew many others

uh yes i agree your assesment boggs rather specifically however
you did say everybody who has ever won batting title has been accused 
selfishness i have ever anywhere heard said puckett pendleton
either similarly brett b williams others 

how about daryl strawberry i think plus minus refers more 
 born again types ie butler gaetti

again you seem making argument from anecdotes other
hand my argument becausejonsaysso variety we have
 other data i have admit i have problems generating lists 
nonwhite players who became infamous religious 
political beliefs while names like butler gaetti dravecky knepper
hersheiser et al come rolling out

 others perhaps simply outspoken except 
case bornagain types i mention
