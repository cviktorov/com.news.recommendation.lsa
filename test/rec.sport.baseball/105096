ill post my guesses some other trivia questions posted

 most career ks one team its ryan perhaps steve carlton

 way gotta walter johnson all were washington
carlton spent too long st louis collect less than 

 rangers hough long time

id also guess hough due his length tenure though i suspect 
bobby witt wasnt far behind maybe even jenkins snuck close

 saves departmentmaybe lee smithhe should have least
 hundred cubbies maybe enough either rsox cards
 maybe gossagenyy sd fingers mil oak

fingers had have achieved either mil sd so yes
id go guess otherwise i thinking reardon has better
chance having min along i would think easily reaching 
 mon

dont know about homerssteals dept

gotta willie maysi am fairly sure he had over steals his
career

 some other articlemets trivia could tim leary least
 losing all teams maybe beating all em too probably seaver
 koosman fit too

hmmmleary really good point id forgotten about him well
 nothing else plenty exmet pitchers category 
could have lost all teams koosman leary torrez ryan seaver
i guess best three guesses would leary ryan either seaver 
koosman
