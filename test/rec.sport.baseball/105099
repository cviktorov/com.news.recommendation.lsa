 batter my amazement umpire missed years
 i played ball worst piece umpiring i ever saw
 

 now sounds like fun topic

 slo pitch softball game we had first base dugout one our
 players hit shot down first base line bases loaded only
 question fair foul ball hits ground chalk flies umpire calls
 foul we give him standard didnt you see chalk line his response
 hit foul half line we all started laughing

 bad we had similar situation slowpitch softball bases loaded
weakest hitter plate he hits line drive over third
basemans head hooked hooked finally landed ten feet 
foul ground almost hitting fence down side field
 umpire called fair ball i coaching third yelling evrybody 
 move up base umps position still fair when 
passed third base 
why other team didnt immediately protest ill never know we
certainly werent going argue about since every body did manage
 advance one base safely

 also time when batted ball ricocheted off my runner
from second base leg fielded ss steps second force 
runner from first throw first time what umpire
called triple play protest removed when we won game anyway
