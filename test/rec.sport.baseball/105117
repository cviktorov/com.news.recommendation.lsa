 real long good post yankee trades omitted
 
 i disagree one point velarde yes maybe yanks should have let
 him develop he rode columbus shuttle way too many times do 
so
 probably fault george matter now his usefulness 
done
 he able develop good player deep his 
career
 least i dont think so his fielding horrendous rd maybe
 hed good short he cant his curve all i think all
 his trips from new york columbus back have demoralized him 
 point he just doesnt care get rid him i saythe sooner 
 better both yanks velarde
 
 
 keith kellerlets go rangers
 


velarde hasnt been columbus i recall about three
years granted he hasnt been full time player 
when he does play ive always thought he had good bat
he might demoralized about playing full time 
he hasnt been shuttled around i think hes been new york
ever since he had hits ab back i
believe 
i dont think he gold glove calibre he doesnt boot
 around either i think velarde given chance
he could become extremely productive i dont have any stats
 back up i dont know his defense would
cost any games i think he could help he has
 year he has hr already same goes 
jim leyrtiz he has big mouth he does get
 job done when he concentrates i think situation
 leyritz he believes he potential
superstar he gets pissed about playing i
think he might have realized something when marlins
 rockies didnt select him
 yanks need worry about bullpen right now
