 chatting about best player all time pointless you
cant compare players from different eras 

 course you can you just have careful about what conclusions
you draw

 you notice best
pitchers stat wise were s s best all around hitters
probably came from s s 

huh s s were worst decades great pitching grove
vance dean whole lot else 

 best allaround hitters statwise ruth gehrig foxx greenberg
hornsby cobb etc all played before s statwise s were 
 graveyard hitters

now we have great number great
pitchers equally great number great hitters fielders also

how do you know which ones do you consider great

about fielding gloves were much smaller than now early
years baseball maybe hitter like sheffield ba hr 
 rbieven though probably fluke year can compared mantle
because pitching sheffield faces faster mention better 

so sheffield also has better shoes more time between pitches you can
run comparison lots things take account

same could said frank thomas who said best hitter since ted
williams although franks defense does suck

well can we compare them cant we

all i am saying you cant compare players from different eras
 you want best player try choosing best players from different eras 

why we can compare players standard era we can
keep mind eratoera differences without throwing up our hands 
despair

way reasonable basis comparison

you havent shown us whats unreasonable about mantlesheffield
comparison you yourself did
