i dont understand all matt williams has demonstrated
throughout his career he wait good pitches hit
he wont take walks hed rather swing im opposing pitcher
why would i groove fastball williams have him hit well
when i know williams swing miss least hit
very well low away curve

matts problem really more ability than attitude isnt hes
got his mind he wants swing away rather hes
still total sucker curve ball looked while 
 he getting better its still his weak point

 whether does him any good have bonds behind him 
netstatmavens probably tell you theres reason 
should he thinks might selffulfilling
prophecy

 whether giants lineup optimal who knows batting bonds
 teams best hitter fifth does seem odd 
hitters arent exactly messrs oba so arent giving much up
 although clark isnt overall offensive force bonds
 he seems better suited spot assuming course 
he starts hitting one days
