 hi 
 
 im german i have been mlb stuff since almost one year now
 many problems occuring me one them era statistic 
 pitchers what does say 

era indicates average number earned runs attributed pitcher per
nine inning game thus pitcher pitched innings gave up earned
run his inning equivelent perfomance would earned runs thus his era
 compute era you simply take number earned runs divided
 innings pitched multiple result 

era erip 

i think another formula era i heard something about last 
year im sure what im gonna give stab allows 
 pitcher pitch more than innings time benefit cuz 
uses outs recorded instead innings pitched

 era erouts recorded

like i said im sure exactly im pretty sure changed
 something sort


 earned run run given up pitcher attributed
 fielding error more specifically error occurs represented
 third out all runs scored after error considered unearned runs
earned runs also runs scored result players who were left base
when pitcher exited game here some examples

 two outs inning men base 
 error occurs represents third out all runs after
 error counted earned runs

 pitcher issues some base balls walks leaves game
before inning completed he responsible people who
were left base those runners who were left base score
 score result error those eraned runs 
attributed pitcher who left game

i hope explains things you
