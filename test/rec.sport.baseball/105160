when i say black i mean usborn black people purposes 
discussion hispanic players were baseball before one 
team s signed lots hispanics because went over better
 local audience than blacks did 

what about black hispanics

good question its my impression backed evidence general
southoftheborderness seems exempt one from hiringfiring effect
i talking about 

back s were some attempts hire black cuban ballplayers 
 were rejected commissioner others

 why would more hispanics stick around than blacks

dont know remember country had special racial
 
laws one group one group only blacks our national history 
 

man you had better do some serious reading i really really doubt you
meant say 

well what did i mean say aside from some shortlived exceptions
 japanese internment ww ii only blacks were affected laws
regarding slavery jim crow miscegenation military service etc 
my claim exclusivity airtight you can come
up exception fine have cookie compared 
 list other racial group put up legal onslaught worth
discussing length
