implicitly you assuming goals scored against winnipeg selanne
 ice can blamed himroger he forward winnipeg has 
lousy defensive record anyway lets put another way john cullens 
 terrible whats your excuse him his powerplay points dont
count neither do selannes 

 you comparing cullen salami i would say valid 
winnipeg lousy defensive team why hell does salami
stand around other teams blueline when puck his own end

 object game feed selanne 
 win feeding selanne does contribute any meaningful way
 winning

knowledgeable hockey observers world over would agree 
feeding selanne so he can score does contribute meaningful way 
winning 

excuse me jets playing hockey let me checkyes just
barely have allowed more goals than have scored sounds 
awful lot like salamis me sounds like would just well
off better he played solid twoway game our friends 
finland claim he capable he did he wouldnt chal
lenging league lead goals would he biplanes might 
challenging first however

youre worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson your team

now lets seeyou have compared timo anderson cullen whos
next mike foligno

we dont know what selanne does best we do know what jets management
wants again object exercise allow selanne 
do what he does best win hockey games

what he does best scoreso i refer you my comment above

some our finnish friends who have watched him play claim he
can play solid twoway game i would have say style
 contribution would more conducive winning dont you 
think so

 now selanne
 grandstanding goal suck did you see way he parades around
 his arms outstretched after scoring goal you would think 
messiah had returned

nope didnt see i too busy watching foligno jump up down after
his goal

i dont believe you did compare him foligno i honestly hadnt
read far

 would help you used little discrimination your thinking your
contributions would more highly valued we could see you werent
trying merely argumentative

cordially always
