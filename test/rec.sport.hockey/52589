ten years ago number europeans nhl roughly quarter
 what now going season numbers euros 
nhl teams have escalated following stats

canadians 
americans 
europeans 

 please note numbers rounded off taken from top
 players each teams my source vancouver sun

 heres point far too many europeans nhl i am sick
 watching game between american canadian team lets say 
red wings canucks seeing names like bure konstantinov 
borshevshky north america isnt toronto detriot quebec
 edmonton particularly annoying numbers euros other
teams getting worse well 

 i live vancouver i hear one more word about pavel bure 
russian rocket i completely throw up now every time i see
 canucks play i keep hoping someone crosscheck bure plexiglassso hard have carry him out stretcher way im 
canucks fan begin 

 okay stretcher remark little carried away point 
i resent nhl owners drafting all europeans instead canadians 
some americans denies young canadians opportunity play 
north american league instead gives europeans who arent even
better hockey players its all hype european mystique sickening
 until nhl owners get over canadian american players continue
 have fight harder get drafted own league

 numbers euros nhl escalating problem clearly
only getting worse

 im all creation european hockey league let bures
 selannes world play own continent

 i just dont want them mine
