when talking about hockey broadcasters lets give moment silence 
remember st louis blues great dan kelly many you may have heard
him late s early s cbs he used do hockey night 
canada intermissions another recently deceased great danny gallivan
 canadiens


i loved dan kelly he usa when i first got hooked hockey back
 so he wasnt always spot top play he
wasnt overly cute those pipes lusty barrel chested voice
 pipsqueak he unlike some fellas we know

i rode hockey mania coattails gretzky boys 
bus my first finals saw islanders sweep them ill never
forget night year later when oilers closed out home 
 pandemonium smoke from million sparklers long emptynet
goal near end dan kelly letting crowds reaction tell 
story few long seconds voice barking through din
dave lumley sews up edmonton sounds stupid 
early me hockey memory always bring thrill since 
ive grown lot more jaded about game i really saddened
 dan kellys passing he one good guys
