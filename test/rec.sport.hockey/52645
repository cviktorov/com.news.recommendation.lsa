 since all penalties fall three classes should
only three penalties

 foul any illegal contact other player his stick your
 body stick you get you out game

 unsportsmanlike contact intentional foul inlcludes all 
 current flavours roughing fighting boarding you get two you
 thrown out game fined

 technical foul bad mouthing ref player coach penalty shot
 awarded two you thrown out game

besides penalty shot one technical team gets penalties
 period opposing team gets penalty shot every additional one
until end period victim gets two shots heshe 
 act shooting when foul ocured

 new rule changes great however i think your rules 
much too complicated how normal average fan able count
how many fouls player has we would even have remember 
names players order determine who drew foul 
course have new subpositions like power center
who just sits slot until blue course puck comes near him
 shooting defenseman point defenseman finally well
 able keep stats best worst penaltyshot takers 
since almost everyone ice getting fouled well able 
see ulf samuellson sp tie domi miss penalty shots like crazy
