 i thinking about who each teams were mvps biggest
 surprises biggest disappointments year

 
 team biggest biggest
 team mvp surprise disappointment
 
 hartford whalers sanderson cassells corriveau

my votes fwiw

team mvp pat verbeek he fans goal mouth feeds he still has 
 goals after terrible start has been examplary sp team captain
throughout tough couple seasons honorable mention nick kypreos 
mark janssens probably more appropriate unsung heroes category than
mvp kypreos goals pim has been hardest working player 
 team janssens underrated defensive center checker i guess
i place greater emphasis hard work than skill when determining value

biggest surprise geoff sanderson he had goals points last season
 center moved left wing has so far put up goals 
points he now has new whaler record power play goals most all coming
from right wing faceoff circle his garden spot honorable mention andrew
cassels terry yake kiddie quartet sanderson poulin nylander 
petrovicky have been attracting most attention cassels just 
 score close points season he has quite nicely assumed 
role number one center team works very well sanderson yake
bounced around minors number seasons still put
up about goals points season yake like sanderson started
performing better offensively once he converted from center wing 
although lefty sanderson went left wing righty yake went 
right side

biggest disappointment hands down john cullen cullen had disasterous 
point season last year his first full season after trade cullen started
 season off summer back surgery fell flat his face appropriate
since he spent all his whaler career flat his ass whining about 
cullen scored just point games clubhouse malcontent commanded
 powerplay success percentage sanderson sulked his
way out town worst all his year m contract had three years left
 run so one would give up any more than nd round draft pick 
maple leafs offered hartford honorable mention steve konroyd also subpar
after signing year m contract eric weinrich who showed flashes 
competence overall has played poorly jim mckenzie who much better
hockey player two seasons ago than he now frank pietrangelo who only
seemed play well when sean burke out extended period he got
 make number starts row
