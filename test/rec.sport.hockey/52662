 course penalties have changed
 
 roughingchauvanistic males being aggressive
 slashingchauvanistic males venting frustration
 fightingproof males cannot cope feelings
 

 since all penalties fall three classes should
only three penalties

 foul any illegal contact other player his stick your
 body stick you get you out game

 unsportsmanlike contact intentional foul inlcludes all 
 current flavours roughing fighting boarding you get two you
 thrown out game fined

 technical foul bad mouthing ref player coach penalty shot
 awarded two you thrown out game

besides penalty shot one technical team gets penalties
 period opposing team gets penalty shot every additional one
until end period victim gets two shots heshe 
 act shooting when foul ocured

 works well several reasons first penalty shots most
exciting thing hockey right so follows more better
next when player setting up penalty shot network can
take commercial finally only three penalties network
announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall 
marv levy among others able tell viewers what happened before
 pa announcer says 

oh one other rule when goal scored times period play
cannot resume until pa announcer announces way network
can sneak few more commercials once pa announcer has told
them who scored tv announcer can tell you viewer even have 
chance pronouncing his name right

seriously though i actually went see nba basketball game last week
 first time my life i amazed how boring play 
so slow actually had fans come out things like freethrow shooting
contests during period course laker girls get do 
routines least times during game just between periods
either whistle every seconds average maybe less 
game minutes minutes between quarters 
 minute halftime still takes over hours

 reason has tv plenty room throw 
commercials have announcer jabber while nothing else happening
 tv basketball fairly entertaining imho better watch
 tv than road nhl following 
 truly sad day

enough now
