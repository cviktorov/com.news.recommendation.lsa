you arent going see naslund year world championship
tournament doesnt start until april so nhl teams wont see any
influx europeans team playing wc see sudden
influx eliminated nhlers earliest player playoff bound
team could join wcteam last game round robin i
doubt any coach going want play short one player long

 actually swedish coach curt lundmark thinking about leaving two
 spots open additions from eliminated nhlers mats sundin 
 calle johansson curt hopes can join team although late
 stage tournament technically i seem recall you can leave
 spots open until hrs before wc final
