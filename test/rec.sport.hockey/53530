im sorry tell you unless pull off another miracle 
 way habs win year ever since traded 
ramage since savard came off injury have been playing shinny 
you cant blame roy loss washington when players could 
score one goal i know you think
i am boston fan all my years have been dedicated les habs

david degan

well seems habs have been much talkedabout late so heres my
 guys have absolutely concept how play front 
damn net watch them offensive zone especially powerplay 
damphousse lebeau skate all over bloody zone maybe pass 
point get back skate some more pass aroundbut wheres shot
answer shot totally useless because lack forward who stands
 front net la neely shanahan tocchet etc etc too bad 
demers wont put dipietro leclair powerplay more often dammit
even ewen would least cause some disruptions montreal desperately needs
 power forward some talent imo

 watch them own zone patrick roy screened everything say
what you want about his performance imnsho he cannot stop what he cannot see 
 montreals defence does miserable job clearing front net 
last night against washington roy played great game first goal came
 most ridiculous goalmouth scramble ive seen long time he
didnt have hope hell stopping shot second goal came 
deflection shot he only partially saw anyway pathetic defence 
third goal en

 wonder he gets pissed off his defencemen
