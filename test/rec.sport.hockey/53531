wales conference adams division semifinal
boston vs buffalo
 bruins playing some excellent hockey cam neely back
 moog his old self again should cakewalk bruins 

im hoping fuhr miracle i agree boston likely win 
series goaltending about equal top offensive players about equal
mogilnylafontaine vs oatesjuneau buffalo has answer neely
 imply neely top offensive player btw fact hes one
 my favourites even though hes damn bruin rest 
matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway i think go six

quebec vs montreal
 one very tough call montreal certainly has experience
factor quebec more talented imho itll come down 
goalies ill go experience roy canadiens 

agreed herebut montreal pushed limit just me 
does everything montreal does playoffs come down roy go habs

final
boston vs montreal
 bruin domination continue rivalry yes moog has
consistently outperformed roy playoffs after other stuff
 bruins five

i cant predict montreal victory because ive been watching them play 
 weeks imo severly need some tougher players especially play
 garden last time beat bs boston had clear
territorial advantage victory roys same time i cant
bring myself predict possibility loss so ill just say i 
 putting money series 

patrick division semifinal

pittsburgh vs ny islanders
what can i say pens flying high have most talent 
 league 

agreed ny doesnt have goaltending stop onslaught independent
 trouble have given pittsburgh year pens five which 
credit ny

washington vs new jersey
capitals 

agreed here too i think go least six jersey has decent
team washington has done poorly against division year

pittsburgh vs washington
 caps had bill ranford i might see upset don beaupre
just doesnt inspire my hopes penguins 

i think use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled i dont
think go six eithermaybe five

conference final
pittsburgh vs boston
 replay last year penguins just good months ago
 bruins much improved penguins 

 pittsburgh plays boston imo win likely five possibly six 
own bruins play montreal i think go seven once
again i wont putting money seventh game i say seven because 
habs have played pittsburgh very tough season

campbell conference norris division semifinal

chicago vs st louis minnesota
 blackhawks 

chicago win i think least six chicago good
imo remember take ridiculous numbers penalties

detroit vs toronto
 leafs have had excellent season theyve been playing
playoff hockey all year habs under burns were same way 
always wilted playoffs red wings 

very true leafs have much proud soon find out
why montreal did so lousy playoffs toronto might win two three 
 mlg though wings six maybe even seven

final
chicago vs detroit
 war fedorov win ot red wings 

 warpossibly most intense playoff series them all 
 yes i think detroit win probert have come up big though

smythe division semifinals

vancouver vs winnipeg
 canucks 

our first disagreement canucks playing like shit dont use 
size all which may explain why get hammered team
chasing them calgarywinnipeg six

calgary vs los angeles
 would have been tough call except three things 
kings dont have goalie gary roberts back kings
shot themselves foot trading proven winner paul coffey
 proven loser jimmy carson gretzky just too weary carry
 group flames 

 also tough me call because i havent seen smythe enough 
i dont think roberts well enough figure coffey 
nonissue who cares what carson has done before never underestimate
gretzky la six

final
vancouver vs calgary
 flames 

 two calgary need six games i think 
lawinnipeg anyway la seven because home ice

coference final
detroit vs calgary
 red wings 

wow mustve been tough go against your team lets see i picked
ladetroit detroit win probably six

stanley cup final
pittsburgh vs detroit
three row official dynasty status pens can 
wings complete dream season well wings better goal 
sufficiently so though imho have better dmen however mario 
 boys can sure score look jagr shine playoffs
though i sure would love see probert beat some sense him 
pens just too much especially since detroit have tougher
battle get here penguins 

 pittsburgh plays detroit go longer than five i wouldnt bet
against wings very strong imo nobody knows how strong
because theyve been underachieving most year forced choose
though id have take penguins

 side note vlad last week you said selanne better player than
gilmour way he more talented pure goal scorerbut aside from
 age difference way i would take him over gilmour my team
im asking flames either btwive spent more than enough time
arguing behalf selanne i still say hes great player while
he gilmour both dangerous offensively give teemu edge
gilmour does all i know lot gilmourbashing goes esp
from flame fans imo you guys letting your dislike gilmour cloud
your judgement when comes his skill he easily one best
allround players nhl
