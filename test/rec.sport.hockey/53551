 pens wont playing montreal because boston win adams
 divisional play buffalo quebec make decent showings
 boston out sheer determination win game against pens
 more have heart pens have too many big guns 
 too many ways win
 
 boston does indeed win adams nothing certain 
 indeed gets play pens i think youll find very
 different boston team year boston use every trick 
 book shut down pens offense something didnt even try
 last year pens weak spot defense goaltending boston

first i enjoyed reading your post second i disagree pens weak
spot being defense goaltending couple reasons barrasso has
had spectacular year slow start consistently sharp gaa 
leads league wins tommy deserves vezina given lack 
respect he commands though i doubt he win other reason 
concerns pens team defense hovering around rd th 
fewest goals allowed big improvement them indicates
 playing better team defense

 can shut down pens offense get early goal you have 
 real game pens score first its practically over i
 dont think pens have discipline stick team game 
 theyre held scoreless minutes second
 
 boston doesnt have guns pens pens doesnt have
 defense goaltending discipline boston still boston can
 put puck net remember boston runandgun
 patrickstyle team although played runandgun hockey 
 better part regular season who doesnt even neely backchecks
 all way behind his own net necessary
 
 penaltykilling big factor boston i believe over
 last something shorthanded situations meaning have
 scored shg while giving up ppg one lackluster game against
 ottawa
 
 id say series go im much less certain
 whether favor pens bs styles going
 playoffs too different make predictable still id
 place my bets pens i think my prediction bs
 can get first goal four games theyll take series
 otherwise pens 
 
 id rather wait see whether bs actually get out
 adams begin buffalo quebec montreal arent
 exactly planning call game go home
