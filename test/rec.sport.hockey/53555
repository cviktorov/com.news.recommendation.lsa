 you have completely missed point selke trophy goes
 best defensive forward forward who forgoes points
 help his team out defensively unsung hero sorts yes
lemieux gilmour good defensive players play more
offensively oriented style than true defensive forward year

you mean guys check cant score guys who can both check
 score shouldnt candidates right

 selke candidate forwards main purpose shift prevent goals
from being scored score them when lemieux gilmour play 
number one purpose score defence secondary especially considering
 line plays against them probably defensive one 
why selke candidates

 when tarasov called bob gainey best player world 
assumed he meaned best technical player one who knew
every intricacy about playing hockey never made technical error

 who made assumption all your friends maybe
sorry greg people arent enoughyou can assume all you
want you think tarasov serious you idiot

someone posted something about assumption being lost translation
 few months ago whoever please repost 

i agree assessment bob gainey may have been best technical
player ever

right greg did you see sun something what did you think
 claude provost gainey nothing more than journeyman player whos
outstanding abilities were entirely political he might have had col
lection defensive skills he had absolutely offensive skills 
all none perhaps you think abilities pass puck shoot
 puck deke goalie defenseman technical skills 

gainey best defensive forward ever i stand assessment
he very good player who belongs hall fame did you
ever watch him play he never made technical error
