 adjust 
 
 first calculate teams goals scored pp goals scored 
 goals allowed pp goals allowed when were penalty killing
 
 divide number take account fact 
 players ice each responsible team 
 
 players adjusted his raw team adjustment
 
 btw anyone could calculate post adjusted ratings would 
 greatly appreciated i might find time do so dont count 
 

i have database filter set up player stats when posted 
 end season ill repost team averages you dont need go through
 complicated team adjustment you using all you need team
average summing all individual players divide total
number players team little distorted because 
players who have been traded recently have come scores based
 original teams shouldnt distort too bad though you
want look individual players from perspective go ahead 
youll require original player stats though

question
 team uses players season do you merely divide total 
 so player who plays only game considered equally
valuable player who plays all them

another way looking same thing compare deviation from
 mean team player standard deviation team
ill post both

since standard deviation each team different i am unsure how 
transferable between teams stats shouldnt average
standard deviation league used

i am interested seeing each method
 i still think mine best other reason than familiarity
