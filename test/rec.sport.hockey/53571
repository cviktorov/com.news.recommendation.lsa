gainey best defensive forward ever i stand assessment
he very good player who belongs hall fame did you
ever watch him play he never made technical error

i watched him over his entire career i have never seen player 
includes russell courtnall davie keon screw up many breakaways 
bob gainey i never forget time denis potvin caught gainey
 his head down you have been sold bill goods bob gainey

gainey plugger when press runs out things say about 
 stars dynasties start hype pluggers grant fuhr essa
tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek
sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri
richard dick duffand so 

 players all pretty good players depth 
dynasties had win stanley cups tend very good second
line guys who would first liners most weaker clubs nhl
 were all important clubs probably several 
stanley cup winning teams would have won cups did 
were depth provided players

 compare rick tocchet ron francis penguins very good
players who can lead lesser teams francishartford tocchetphilly who
provide depth team currently best nhl

 defensive forward have been none better than bob gainey 
doesnt mean he best player even best forward canadians
had time he excellent what he did gainey could
dominate games his defence he didnt need get goals dominate
he shut down opposition thus valuable has never been
anyone any better doing ever
