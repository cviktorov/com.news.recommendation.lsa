chances year seems me like washington only
team can stop penguins from winning next stanley cup

 really i think both islanders devils would have better chance
 penguins than capitals imo

really what makes you think islanders have better shot 
couldnt even beat whalers two games

yes has been mentioned many times before islanders play 
 talent level opponent since hartford pitiful 
islanders played pitiful since pittsburgh great isles most
likely play great most likely due inexperience very poor
shooting greg yes i have noticed islanders couldnt hit
 broad side barn puck were two feet front 
 does anyone have shooting percentages i dont know would
help since often miss net completely might shed some
light subject
