sorry roger mr basketbal should what he really means here ie he should
have said he hopes fans american southeast can follow 
names divisions odds people other than those who
 displaced notherners who probably already fans order
 proverbial snowballs hell

i am all clear about what you trying say here you
asked somone who had never heard hockey before la played 
 smythe division what do you think response would 
what you asked person la played west division 
naming divisions after longdead entrepreneurs unnecessary
obfuscation

i am glad names being changed another reason names
patrick smythe norris adams campbell all names socalled
builders game same type thinking put stein
 hall fame absolute nonsense real builders 
game richard morenz howe conacher orr etc you going 
name divisions after people least name divisions after people
who deserve 

yes people deserve recognigtion hockey greats old division
names took account messers patrick norris smythe prince who 
had alot more do origins league than people who came 
 already established situation much easier element change

hardly established situation existed prior smythe et al
 stanley cup challenge trophy up grabs whatever team
could successfully mount challenge what our dear founders did
 formalize challenge created closed league oligop
olistic professional system interests making money wheth
er system has contributed better hockey certainly
debatable we however stuck invention de
bate academic point made however people
played hockey people enjoyed watching hockey long before smythe
 his pals showed up

 standout existing situation than someone who creates
 new situation you want honor players like bobby orr than im sure
you can find reason name torphy after him best offensive 
defenseman

whats wrong best defenceman period ever better
defenceman ever better player you think 
bruce norris contribution somehow more significant than bobby
orrs interests education why dont you take poll
 find out how many people know who norris you dont have
 do you

 i cant reasons i gave above im same boat jason i
grew up current divisonal names learned them when i about 
 years old who played what division year old american
can learn why would hard occasional fan pick up 
 who plays what division

so you dont feel you should have make effort remember
 vancouver plays west division pacific whatever
other intuitively understandable moniker chosen

oh now i see your point your intention has been alert us erosion
 purity ill bet you like hockey because its most part played
 whites european extraction 

probably my case im sure what you said would like me
saying all maple leafs fans biased closed minded ignorant

 course you neatly deleted jasons jingoistic rant about 
game losing its canadianization quoting me out context does
more erode your credibility than does mine my position 
clearly progressive anything biased closed minded ig
norant arrogant i grant you

arrogant moronic you just because someone doesnt like what
mr basketball doing b voices opinion c likes senerio 
you going antartica does mean you have right insult them

nice try john flame truly effective you have 
display least enough intelligence earn your targets
respect

cordially always
