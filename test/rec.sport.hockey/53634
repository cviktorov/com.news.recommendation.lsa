i think you incorrect roger patrick
smythe adams all played coached league before becoming
front office types hence did help build league although
 were great players themselves 

punch imlachs contributions coach gm were far greater than
those above combined should we name division trophy after
him smythe norris bunch were honoured purely because 
were powerful owners owners certainly did help build 
league whether developed game another question altogether
 we going honour those who contributed leagues evolution
 we going honour those who contributed glory 
sport itself 

i agree name name name some people
have trouble names easily processed fans
 changing them names more easily processed seems like
 reasonable idea we can get people arena door being
uncomplicated lets do so once we have them realize
what great game hockey we can teach them something
abotu history game 

i cant disagree you here

 history names can put rather succinctly all aforemen
tioned used game hockey make money can you imagine pocklington
division ballard division how about green division

 i would want see ballard division say
 owners assholes hence all nhl management people 
assholes would fallacious conn smythe example classy
individual from what i have heard 

what have you heard major definitive little asshole he
originated phrase you cant beat em alley you cant beat
em ice his idea hockey do you think chance
 don cherry classy individual

also isnt point professional hockey make money
 all those involved which would include players what i think
you might saying players have made much money 
should have been due players what make
 game great people who put them ice so naming
division after management people rather than players adding insult
 form lesser recognition injury less money than 
deserved 

 money issue irrelevant point we would agree 
 players what make game great 
people who put them ice

exactly true naming divisions trophies after smythe bunch
 same kind nepotism put stein hall fame i have
always thought nonsense
