 i would want see ballard division say
 owners assholes hence all nhl management people 
assholes would fallacious conn smythe example classy
individual from what i have heard 

 depends what you mean classy from what ive heard about
him he about classy harold ballard only difference 
 back almost all owners were like so he seemed okay
 comparison read book net worth one view what smythe
 norris adams campbell were like 

also isnt point professional hockey make money
 all those involved which would include players what i think
you might saying players have made much money 
should have been due players what make
 game great people who put them ice so naming
division after management people rather than players adding insult
 form lesser recognition injury less money than 
deserved 


 even more specifically i think what roger saying i said
 previously too people who made 
league great so why should divisions conferences etc named after
them instead morenz vezina howe orr etc people who did
make great instead nhl has chosen immortalize men who
got rich off men who made game great
