 while we subject has captain ever been traded 
resigned been striped his title during season any other 

 leafs have always been kind comical during second imlach
era when darryl sittler called cancer team he tore 
c off his sweater while leafs didnt have captain

sittler eventually ended up philly he promised philly
captaincy new gm sittlers friend bobby clarke instead
sittler got traded detroit

rick vaive leaf captain awhile he slept one day 
 took captaincy away from him he traded chicago

during doug carpenters tenure leaf coach attempt kiss
 ass sulking gary leeman leafs took away from brad
marsh give leeman leeman wouldnt take when tried
 give back marsh he wouldnt take neither

 best story i remember about captain concerned mel bridgman late
 senators while he philadelphia bobby clarke arguably
one great captains all time bumped up status 
playing coach so he had relinquish captaincy bridgman 
came new captain reporter asked flyer what bridgman did 
captain since clarke still undisputed leader amongst 
players reporter told bridgman charge making
sure soap dispensers showers were always full
