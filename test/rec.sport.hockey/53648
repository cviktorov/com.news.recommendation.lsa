aargh

paul stewart worst most biased ref presently nhl
he called total penalties habs one nordiques
 nords penalty came ot stewart being exnordique himself
 looking call penalties habs while letting nords
get away murderwe robbed

 excellent game plenty endtoend rushes tremendous
goalkeeping nords tied over minute go while lebeau
 serving penalty i dont mind stewart calling penalty 
last min game least fair about nords were
caught hand cookie jar more than once stewart turned
 other cheekbastard

patrick roy collapsed after letting tieing goal he shaky 
 his knees rest night winning goal shouldnt have
gone 

dont get me wrong im blaming loss stewart habs had
plenty chances capitalize muller leclair haller etc 
failed put puck net thats what did them 
mr stewart didnt help matters all

oh well least bruins lost ot also ha ha
