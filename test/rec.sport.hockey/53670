 lemieux clearly mvp

 question here chip masterson well

 selanne wins calder

yep 

 chelios norris

 you asked me days ago id agree you i now give nod 
raymond bourque his play took off same time bs did chelios
gets close second

 dunno who wins vezina i suspect potvin 
 
barrasso finally gets his due close one over eddie eagle

 coach year tricky burns did most least raw talent
 king did good job flames clearly underachieved last year brian
 sutter has done exceptionally well his first year new team ditto
 demers page has been blessed ripening acquisition young
 talent darryl sutter having good year rookie coach berry made
 best bad situation terry crisp worked minor miracles bowman
 bowman id pick burns im mildly biased

 your case bias acceptable mine shows norris pick
so were even

im impressed what all coaches you mentioned did my pick would 
al arbour too many folks thought isles would playoffs let 
alone contend rd division granted did have little
help from cousins broadway 

 i like islanders about much i like mowing my lawn
