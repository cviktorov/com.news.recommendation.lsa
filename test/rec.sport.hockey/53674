 bryan trottier denis potvin vicious
boarding from behindtrottier given major

perhaps trottier happened behind habs goal i recall
gainey simply didnt have his head up he picking up puck

 roger what hell does have do gaineys skill
 hockey player probert smashes gilmours head 
boards next week diminish your assessment gilmours
skills

 gilmour taken completely surprise gainey yeah
i would have say doug wasnt playing technically smart 
hockey any case claim greg did gainey never made 
 technical mistake absolutely ludicrous

gainey plugger when press runs out things 
say about stars dynasties start hype 
pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob
nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne
cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard
dick duffand so 
 
i would take fuhr sanderson off latter

good you youd only displaying your ignorance course 
each his own

i think gainey would honoured know youve included him

i think gainey should feel honoured know he remembered 
all

 list i also think you have relatively naive view
about what wins hockey gamepluggers integral part 

certainly pluggers integral part any team 
simply because enough solid twoway players go 
around who would you rather have your checking centre doug
gilmour doug jarvis matter i would take either gretzky
 mario my checking centres do you think gretzky could cover
bob gainey 

any team selke designed acknowledge 
contributioni think most people understand its 
 nobel prizeso settle down

youre wrong again selke awarded forward does 
best job defensively may may best plugger 
gilmour does best defensive job league i dont see why he 
should out running simply because he also contributes offen
sively

settle down you think i have likened selke nobel
prize i suggest you had best settle down you 
going try put words my mouth let me suggest you settle 
down before you bother following up my postings 

congenially always
