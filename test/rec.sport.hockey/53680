certainly pluggers integral part any team 
simply because enough solid twoway players go 
around who would you rather have your checking centre doug
gilmour doug jarvis matter i would take either gretzky
 mario my checking centres do you think gretzky could cover
bob gainey 

gretzky lemieux gilmour etc do play role checking centreman
 play offensive role opposed defensive one 
were used defensive centres would waste offensive
abilities 

when you compare gretzky et al jarvis gainey etc you comparing 
apples oranges like me telling you felix potvin isnt 
very good because team would better had lemieux instead 
him sure lemieux better player he different type 
player team successful need have all types 
players includes defensive forwards

when compared other defensive forwards bob gainey greatest
defensive forward ever he player whos talents best suited being
 defensive forward who completely dominated game when he played

maybe more talented player gretzky had decided waste his
offensive talents play defensively he could have been better
defensive forward he wasnt

bob gainey best defensive forward has ever played hockey
