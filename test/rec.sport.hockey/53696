 gilmour taken completely surprise gainey 
yeah i would have say doug wasnt playing
technically smart hockey any case claim greg did
 gainey never made technical mistake absolutely
ludicrous
 
later your posting you make reference putting words
 other peoples mouthsi would suggest your last
paragraph can only interpreted one waynamely i
along greg claim gainey never made technical
mistake you actually read what ive written you find
 i make claimsoooo logic serves me well
youre contradicting yourself

nonsense i quite clearly state greg made claim
 gainey never made error he made claim read below

from recsporthockey thu apr 
from gballenthudsonuvicca greg ballentine

nonsense deleted

gainey best defensive forward ever i stand assessment
he very good player who belongs hall fame did you
ever watch him play he never made technical error

more nonsense deleted

good you youd only displaying your ignorance 
course each his own
 
roger im sure here i think ignorance really 
function lack knowledge formulating 
opinionbut hey you need take cheap shot all
means go aheadthats makes you feel better

 knowledgeable observers game my meaning obvious your
hockey education my responsibility
 
my word vehemence against poor ol bob gainey why does
he bother you so muchhe effective player his style
 play

he just another player laud him anything more i find
bothersome i hated habs i hated lafleur until i realized
 he likely most aesthetically pleasing player ever 
skate my lifetime why would anyone talk about gainey
 
go around who would you rather have your checking
centre doug gilmour doug jarvis matter i would
take either gretzky mario my checking centres do you
think gretzky could cover bob gainey

im really sorry roger you have lost me completely here 
why dont you ask me i would rather have jesus christ
himself nets

did he play hockey high level he any good why
would you bother bring jc up i am talking about hockey players
here you cant follow conversation dont follow up i
said previously my responsibility educate you

now you were compare say example bob gainey guy
carbonneau you would have balanced comparison

sure two journeymen big deal neither one them worth
discussing

im wrong againhmmm lets seewhere i wrong 

i would take fuhr sanderson off latter

first place im only guessing here rog i have feeling
 youve setup youre wrong again macro key your
machine

 excellent idea i decide waste any more time
responding any your gregs postings i sure
 implement very macro
 
i would suggest your comment when press runs out
 things say about stars dynasties start hype
 pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob
nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman
bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick
duffand so demonstrates blanket disregard 
individuals contributors gameso yes settle
downnobody has claimed hockey gods

tarasov claimed gainey hockey god greg ate up
 what thread all about you didnt know 
 why you responding

 blanket disregard individuals i can remember 
leaf teams purely populated individuals winning four 
stanley cups teams one ran around telling us george
armstrong best hockey player world

congenially always
