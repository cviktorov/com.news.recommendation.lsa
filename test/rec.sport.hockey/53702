good you youd only displaying your ignorance 
course each his own
 
roger im sure here i think ignorance really 
function lack knowledge formulating 
opinionbut hey you need take cheap shot 
all means go aheadthats makes you feel better
 
 knowledgeable observers game my meaning obvious 
your hockey education my responsibility
 
my hockey education what f you talking about im
 even going try refute absolutely insane statement 
 
my word vehemence against poor ol bob gainey why does
he bother you so muchhe effective player his
style play
 
he just another player laud him anything more i find
bothersome i hated habs i hated lafleur until i realized
 he likely most aesthetically pleasing player 
ever skate my lifetime why would anyone talk about gainey
 
i hate habs you sound like year old 
statement just further exemplifies your total inability 
argue objectively about hockey dont give me crap about
cogent argumentsive yet read something yours 
cogent you consistently argue emotion huge
sweeping statements
 
frankly you have very unconvincing style
 
im defending bob gaineyfrankly i dont care him all
 much your dismissal him something less than 
effective hockey player tiresomeit has basis 
anything how many calders did he win i think four go
ahead refresh my memory what about conn smythe 
 fluke yeah makings hockey superstar i
know try have reason any reason shoot him down
 
go around who would you rather have your checking
centre doug gilmour doug jarvis matter i would
take either gretzky mario my checking centres do you
think gretzky could cover bob gainey
 
im really sorry roger you have lost me completely here 
why dont you ask me i would rather have jesus christ
himself nets
 
did he play hockey high level he any good 
why would you bother bring jc up i am talking about hockey
players here you cant follow conversation dont follow
up i said previously my responsibility 
educate you
 
hey cowboy youre expert who introduced idiotic
comparison gainey gretzky lemieuxyou figure 
out
 
now you were compare say example bob gainey 
guy carbonneau you would have balanced comparison
 
sure two journeymen big deal neither one them worth
discussing
 
how many individual awards between them eighti dont remember
once again please feel free refresh my memoryand try 
 sarcastic possible about my hockey education
 
im wrong againhmmm lets seewhere i wrong 
 
i would take fuhr sanderson off latter
 
oh my god did i say rogerwhats your point fuhr
 goaltender goaltenders dont plugin his prime he 
one best sanderson scrapperif you stick him 
you may well include half flyers team same era
 
first place im only guessing here rog i have feeling
 youve setup youre wrong again macro key your
machine
 
 excellent idea i decide waste any more time
responding any your gregs postings i 
sure implement very macro
 
oh roger you shouldntreally i dont deserve thisyou 
far too accomodating already
 
i would suggest your comment when press runs out
 things say about stars dynasties start 
hype pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring
bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne
cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard
dick duffand so demonstrates blanket disregard 
 individuals contributors gameso yes settle
downnobody has claimed hockey gods
 
tarasov claimed gainey hockey god greg ate
 up what thread all about you didnt
know why you responding
 
you seem have allowed all other players fall 
your sweeping vacuous statementthats why you want 
debate gainey go aheadbut why bring up everybody else how
does support your argument do you have argument do
you just like throw around few names hoping impress us
 
 
 blanket disregard individuals i can
remember leaf teams purely populated individuals
winning four stanley cups teams one ran around telling
us george armstrong best hockey player 
world
 
great i couldnt agree more flyers won two cups 
same reasonsdeservedly so so what i dont get you
angry leafs didnt get more recognition 
 
you seem think pluggers hypedi dont
agreeplain simple youre last statement some sort
 compromise fair enough
 
you might consider developing your own style after all
imitation sincerest form flattery i am quite
sure flattery your intention
 
cmonit has nice ring itand admit you had good
laugh
 
right i had get end your posting before i
realized you were complete joke
 
 pleasant bone your body eh rog why you so
unhappy getting invited enough parties what
 
 future you going respond my postings i
would appreciate you could present cogent argument
supported facts gleaned from version reality most
 rest us would recognize
 
roger why you under impression responding your
posts some great honour you really should stopit sounds
 little bit pathetic frankly its about honourable 
good fart
 
congenially always
