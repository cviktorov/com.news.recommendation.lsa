selannes leads jets teppo numminen who do you think
 better defensively ron francis penguins although he
has points while jaromir jagr has only points 
jagr really better defense than francis how exactly should we
interpret fact mario lemieux has far highest 
 league does he get selke well ross

 plusminus does measure defense alone attempts measure
 players total contribution team effort certainly 
 far from perfect my posting never implied otherwise all 
my posting suggested better indicator 
players effectiveness when examined context players
teams performance than mere scoring totals alone mario
getting selke why after doug gilmour i would rather have
lemieux ice any situation other than enforcer obvi
ously than any player game i used call selke bob
gainey award came about result statement made 
anatoli tarasov bob gainey best hockey player world
i am sure tarasov either misquoted originally had tiny
bit too much vodka toying reporter any event 
nhl decided honour one dimensional checkers along one dimen
sional scorers maybe league should start awarding doug gil
mour award anually leagues most effective allround player

cordially always
