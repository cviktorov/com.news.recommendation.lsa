 now what two teams were merged has been proposed tampere 
 ilves lynx tappara axe fans wouldnt take 
 rather see teams out playoffs most time even 
 relegated than merged its difficult understand its just 
 like here helsinki you grow up being either jokerit hifk fan
 other team last team world you would support im 
 talking about hate about extremely deeply rooted rivalry

deeply rooted rivalry ahem jokerit have been around since joined
 top flight only early s helsingfors ifk have been around since
 fans only started taking hockey seriously s so i think
youre exagerating here

 however its been proved both fan groups can cheer same team
 thats finnish national team maybe thats how you could set up 
 huge franchise finland one has ever said team must 
 called after one city play all its games one arena just one team 
 finland team sweden nhl just wouldnt make any sense we have 
 way more talent than th total north american talent after 
 couple seasons you would never see cup going anywhere outside 
 nordic presuming our teams would have advantage drafting 
 local talent prooposed

thats rather bold claim light how successful canadian 
american olympic teams have been theyve had play according our
set rules international ice olympic teams contained about
 much talent your average expansion team canada had eric lindros sean
burke joe juneau chris kontos another four five have been deep subs 
 nhl yanks keith tkachuk scott lachance bret hedican shawn 
mceachern steve heintze ted donato joe sacco bill guerin have been 
rdth line players nhl while robb stauber has done well 
kings goal nothing more fact im sure allstar team assembled
from best finnish league teams would do better nhl than hartford 
 tampa bay currently doing

 what happens all topclass finnish swedish players gradually end up
 helsinki stockholm north americanbased ones gradually retire 
 canadianamerican team allowed draft new players from scandinavia 
here what hockey news scouts think our nhlbased players

superstar
star
nhl regular
nhl regular
 role player

 would interesting clearly finlands top five players winnipegs
selanne numminen vancouvers lumme los angeles jari kurri new yorks
tikkanen right up any fiveman unit pittsburgh co have 
i have my doubts about homebased finnish players national team did
well canada cup world championships largely due efforts 
markus ketterer goalie players listed above luck theres
presumably lot decent players finland wouldnt superstars 
 highest level still valuable role players however my guess would 
 finnish canada cup team would team nhl

sweden easier judge because have more players north america
 points total players seven more than ottawas top
players combined we estimate six more nhl regulars back home 
sweden allswedish team would assemble about skill points
deducting some points from pittsburgh ny rangers other teams rely 
swedish players swedish team would finish sixth place about high
 boston vancouver calgary montreal paper so dynasty talk
isnt completely unfounded here allfinnishallswedish team might have 
advantage because players would playing home half time
wont have adapt foreign country foreign language presumably
play wideopen european variant hockey rather than have learn 
north american checking game however free agency becomes factor top 
scandinavian players still might end up playing largemarket teams after 
couple years same way edmontons dynasty crumbled late s 
some fringe players likely drafted other nhl teams having 
exclusive talent pool might bit unfair after all id settle 
compromise prohibit all european teams from signing north american during 
 first two rounds allow them keep top two players after 
 amateur draft should open anyone
