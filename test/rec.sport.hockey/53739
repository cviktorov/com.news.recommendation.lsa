however aside real question whether you like idea 
changing names based reasons given making easier 
 casual fan whether you like idea unique divisional names
based individuals who do deserve honour imo latter nice
 unique touch differs from other sports addition i do 
think changing divisional names have effect number 
people interested hockey so its pointless exercise anyway

 several problems way game being presented 
fans i feel geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
more than names honouring personages course would appear
nearly confusing one approaching sport first time 
another thing bothers me points system percentages used 
 other major sports clearly more informative when i look 
nhl standings first thing i have do make quick calculation 
account games hand which almost always case some 
object percentages claiming perhaps americanization
 sport i feel using percentages more informative 
whether american irrelevant
 
 current names inappropriate separate issue 
central original article something consider additionally 
whether players like orr who contributed glory sport
would have been able do so without organized professional league 
play case honouring builders league opposed 
builders sport becomes chickenandegg type question although
 chicken

even orr couldnt have contributed without likes norris you would
have agree norris couldnt have contributed without likes orr
 taking poll most fans would quickly tell you who fans feel made
 more meaningful contribution

exactly true naming divisions trophies after smythe bunch
 same kind nepotism put stein hall fame i have
always thought nonsense

dunno stein comparison justifiable since doesnt look though
his unanimous acceptance hall hold up

 doesnt look division names going hold up either does
