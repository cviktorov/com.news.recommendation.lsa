i also think have hard time pittsburgh 
face them finals which what all detroit sportswriters 
 predicting although i think bryan murray probably best gm
i have ever seen hockey

how do you figure when bryan murray took over wings were
 pretty good team contending stanley cup looked
unlikely win now pretty good team contending 
 stanley cup looks unlikely win truly great gm would
have been able make moves push team upper echelon
 nhl maybe win stanley cup good gm like murray can
maintain teams success cant push them next level

when jacques demers brought wings conference finals twice 
few years back he had everyone team giving percent he 
had very little talent he had yzerman bob probert who had drinking
problems time couple decent goaltenders hanlon 
stefan who got hot thats about can you name one player those
earlier teams who even deserved allstar game much less 
actually got other than yzerman probert like petr klima
give me break when faced edmonton both those conference
finals hard played clear faced team simply
had superior talent wings thats why could get 
finals also time norris division still weakest 
division hockey getting past chicago toronto 
impressive today

murray has brought scoring talent wings did have 
few years ago when devellano gm demers coach name few
ysebaert kozlov paul coffey who has made definite positive impact 
 power play especially 

murray has built one most talented teams hockey present 
 possible exception pittsburgh penguins wings have least
five goal scorers i can think couple defenseman over
 games worth playoff experience murrays one failing unlike
 other gms you mentioned who definitely also good dont get me
wrong he has found himself strong coach motivate team 
go out give percent full minutes every night like 
did last time made cup run when team wins loses its 
reflection gm coach which point my original 
post team outmatches opponent terms talent loses
anyway which has been case year when wings have struggled
 indicates gm has done his job building up team 
coach has failed motivate them case last run 
wings made playoffs before murray came gave opponents hard
time who should have beaten them easily indicates good coaching making
up lack talent

all fine i never said murray bad gm i merely said
 he isnt best gm hockey even contender honor
 murray great you claim wings would have won stanley cup
 now probably more than once he great gm you claim
 he poor coach you claim he would have been intelligent
enough hire coach push team next level success
 murray average unspectacular nhl coach pretty good gm
so none true anyway
