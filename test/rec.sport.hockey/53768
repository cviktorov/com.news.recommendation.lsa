i think you incorrect roger patrick
smythe adams all played coached league before becoming
front office types hence did help build league although
 were great players themselves 

punch imlachs contributions coach gm were far greater than
those above combined should we name division trophy after
him owner vs player contributions deleted
 we going honour those who contributed leagues evolution
 we going honour those who contributed glory 
sport itself 

stuff deleted

 money issue irrelevant point we would agree 
 players what make game great 
people who put them ice
 
 i recall author original article started thread
claimed he disliked changing names variety reasons 
roger one front you flamed him rather severely grounds his
 jingoistic rant you also supported namechanging 
grounds current names inappropriate because individuals
 represent fwiw i do think flaming warranted nor do i 
think you enhanced what credibility you have all just 
observation

however aside real question whether you like idea 
changing names based reasons given making easier 
 casual fan whether you like idea unique divisional names
based individuals who do deserve honour imo latter nice
 unique touch differs from other sports addition i do 
think changing divisional names have effect number 
people interested hockey so its pointless exercise anyway

 current names inappropriate separate issue 
central original article something consider additionally 
whether players like orr who contributed glory sport
would have been able do so without organized professional league 
play case honouring builders league opposed 
builders sport becomes chickenandegg type question although
 chicken

exactly true naming divisions trophies after smythe bunch
 same kind nepotism put stein hall fame i have
always thought nonsense

dunno stein comparison justifiable since doesnt look though
his unanimous acceptance hall hold up
