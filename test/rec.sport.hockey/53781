larry depalmaseasonrd
acquired free agent from minnesota
gradei cd

 netterfan watching sharks including me knows where depalma 
 end season sharks appeared still have his rights he
wasnt san jose he wasnt kansas city his name hasnt appeared 
 waiver wire kind invisibility prevalent most part
 depalma after being called up october against tampa bay lightning
depalma had excellent week scoring points games while playing good
defense unfortunately yearold depalma disappeared rest 
 way getting just more points more games generally looked
lethargic uninterested both ends ice he sent down 
kansas city walked out from suspended later reinstated
when revealed he injured he promptly disappeared from
 watching eyes shark bytes mailing list now known sharks
officials faithful neither sharks nor we miss him

johan garpenlovseason rd
acquired trade detroit d bob mcgill th round
pick entry draft from vancouver
gradeaa

after early slump garpenlov nothing short inspirational rest
 way finishing points games second highest total 
team he clicked well team mvp kelly kisio right wing rob
gaudreau kisio got most credit garpenlov finishing second 
 mvp voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking scoring skills he
 seen making excellent centering passes well finishing passes him
 putting puck past opposing goaltenders getting clubhigh power
play goals contrary his previous rep garpenlov also showed despite
his small size lbs he willing throw himself around
when necessary albeit very successful yet he also still needs work
 his defense although he improved tremendously throughout season 
 actually quite good penalty killer end season he 
 major key offense next year

david bruceseason th
acquired from st louis expansion draft
gradei 

after banner when he led team powerplay goals 
 third total scoring points games bruce bothered
virtually all season groin injury which kept him out 
lineup all games season course difficult 
speculate how well he would have done season had he been affected 
 injury yearold bruce effective man up man
short sharks first season expected strong offensive
leader season well injury appears serious which shame
because otherwise he may have much brighter future now instead his
future sharks next season appears clouded

mark pedersonseasonrd
acquired trade philadelphia clw dave snuggerud
gradei b

 difficult me understand flyers decision unload pederson
after very good offensive season last season points games 
after riding pine early season pederson summarily sent 
sharks exchange defensiveminded snuggerud he finished 
 games combined flyers sharks he also limited 
injuries season limited his production points when
healthy pederson appears impressive good scoring touch good size
 willingness throw around although hes considered 
physical forward good speed he also does appear liability
 defense sharks probably have wait until next season see how
much exactly pederson can do

john carterseason th
acquired free agent from boston
gradei bb

carter definitely one hardest workers team hard
work worked wonders times he looked great ice however although he
did look great times fact he received just points 
games his efforts sign only so much his hard work can
do sharks confirmed sending him kansas city about
 games left season carter who turn may always
hussled result sometimes trapped too deep within offensive
zone while forechecking he generally credit defensive end
 he probably limited utility capacity he did impress
offensively although he one best sharks drawing penalties he
 very unlikely back next season

jeanfrancois quintinseason st
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradei bb

i dont understand why sharks didnt let quintin play any more than 
 games he played season he generally hardworking creating
opportunities offensively appeared age ready regular nhl
duty least team like sharks finishing points those
 games while being defensive liability shoulder injury training
camp before season limited quintin teams leading scorer 
exhibition games despite sitting out final two just games 
sharks blades season he looked impressive he should 
solid contender regular duty next season

mark beaufaitseason st
acquirednd round pick supplemental draft
gradei 

after allstar season kansas city beaufait got cup coffey 
sharks late season when blades knocked down playoff spot 
sharks decimated injuries playing games scoring goal his only
nhl point thus far despite small size lbs beaufait shy
 throw himself around when necessary looked pretty good times
although its too early judge him based nhl games which he played
mostly left wing away from his center position northern michigan 
kansas city

jaroslav otevrelseason st
acquiredth round pick entry draft
gradei 

like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when he 
up his cup tea games midway through season he generally
very much defensive liability did show much offensively either
although may more indicative lack ice time he got those
 games he may need another season work his defense once his
defense acceptable he should ready

michel picardseason st
acquired trade hartford lw yvon corriveau
gradei bc

 yearold picard although he perennially tore up minors seems 
 close being out chances some reason after being acquired 
sharks failing impress management games scoring goals 
his only points he spent most rest way kansas city
he particularly strong defensively despite his offensive
brilliance minors he has failed thus far score nhl although
he has been given limited opportunities he may sharks bait 
expansion draft

dody woodseason st
acquiredrd round pick entry draft
gradei dd although perhaps i shouldnt give grade all

i have been accused knocking wood too much probably
 surprise you i am thoroughly unimpressed wood thus far although
 games small example he generally nonfactor offense 
 particularly good defensively took too many silly penalties losing
many fights process gathering penalty minutes those games
projecting game season hes ready needs 
least another season kc where he can work his fighting skills 
nothing else his relatively small size lbs does give much
possibility he can survive stage enforcer
