 detroit red wings put lot doubter ice tonight 
washing toronto maple leafs all you toronto fans have now seen 
power mighty red wing offense torontos defense match 
wing offense defense probert kennedey primeau came out

did move probert back defense why did i see him parking his ass
 front potvin all night somebody going have discipline
probert leafs want win series perhaps fresh clark should
hit ice end long probert shift straigten him out 
 while


during regular season when intensity down many teams
have forwards who continually go park themselves front 
 opposing teams netand inadequacy leafs defense 
 regard thus didnt matterhowever playoffs different
storyevery good team going have players who going 
become potted plants front potvinand leafs relatively
unphysical defensive core finally exposed weak inept

hard work go long way during regular seasonalmost
 pointsand leafs deserve credit thatbut 
playoffs talent matters because everyone begins working hard
