 ok heres solution your problem move canada yesterday i able
 watch four gamesthe njpitt abc lacal cbc 
 buffbos tsn fox monque cbc i think 
 each series goes its max i could watching hockey playoffs some odd
 consecutive nights i havent counted so thats pure guess

 worst thing exactly what i did last year i had rangers
 msg two different games scny sca same time yes
id rather have sc cover just amount coverage

 
 btw those abc commentaters were great i quite impressed seemed
 know audience wasnt likely wellschooled hockey lore
 did excellent job were quite impartial also imo

i think thorne earns his money best part he same way when 
he earning his from sportschannel devils announcer ie
unbiased he goes orgasmic goals despite which team scores even more 
excited possible great saves he did good job explaining certain 
things nonhockey types without offending those us who follow sport
unlike nbcs clowns asg

ob playofftime flamebait

 dont any you pittsburgh fans tell me how mike lange better 
 maybe he were little spontaneous rather than reading rehearsed
 lines bs having nothing do hockey he would better
