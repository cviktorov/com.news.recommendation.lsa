 while we subject has captain ever been traded 
resigned been striped his title during season any other 
team captain trivia would appreciated

pittsburgh

mom

chris chelios montreals cocaptain guy carbonneau when he
 traded chicago denis savard peter stastny captain 
 quebec nordiques when he traded newjersey also mark 
messier captain edmonton oilers when he traded new
york how about dale hawerchuk winnipeg when he traded 
buffalo he captain too i think so i should forget wayne 
you know who when he traded la he captain didnt 
strip wendel clark his captaincy toronto 


buffalo seems have started tradition trading its captains

pat lafontaine awarded captaincy when mike ramsey forced
 give up ramseys now penguin ramsey inherited from mike
foligno whos now leaf he turn had inherited from lindy
ruff who went i forget where ruff had from perreault who
retired so i guess thats where streak started did 
after all danny gare captain before him he went detroit
jim scoenfeld gerry meehan floyd smith others 
reverse order last first i bit young time so im
 sure fate schoenfeld he ultimately went detroit
 boston meehan went vancouver atlanta washington smith
seems have hung up his skates after buffalo i dont know 
 captaincy removed before after how many games he
played buffalo actually getting fascinating 

captaincy buffalo sure sign youre traded almost
unless youre franchise player
