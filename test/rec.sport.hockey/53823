how long can leafs play shorthanded still expected 
score did some fine penelykilling first men down
 couple minutes one point just couldnt keep 
up spent virtually entire game either shorthanded 
just coming off penelty soon theyd get regrouped theyre
penalized again
 
sheesh like gilmour said after st you cant go calling 
every little push shove game like youre going
 you have do both teams
 
pearson one my four favorite leafs played like bonehead i
saw him personally screw up least good scoring opportunities 
 he got bonehead minute major highsticking penalty
 
cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury handfull 
games ago he played good game other players his line
can smarten up line should do okay clarks got get tough 
hes got intimidate go net send clark up left 
wing over blue line couple times his patented wrist shot 
put some numbers board pearson heck maybe he should
 benched
 
i hate repeat grapes where heck foligno zezel cant
do all checking himself get macllwain move we 
need some speed out keep potvin net he did okay 
considering although like i said couple weeks ago potvin 
messed up couple games ahl playoffs last year he can 
easily do again
 
my prediction last week toronto games det wins 
 blowouts game tor wins close i still stand
 
 
dont fret leafs fans order win other team has 
win 
 
burns going make some magic hell mix up some lines match
 wings lineperline hell have his team checking hard hell
never let them get outnumbered own end leafs win
wednesday night take home games probably 
first one
