 i think jack ferreiras firing eventually led kingstons
 firing you mention consistency vision i think 
 sharks lost loss ferreira has never
 been headed gm has ever worked you need one
 person making personnel decisions top 
 management committee conventional wisdom
 from around league ferreira would have
 made moves would have fielded better product
 ice
 
 how exactly would ferreira accomplished threeheaded gmship has
 taken lot heat nobodys explained how things would have been any
 different had ferreira still been would ferreira have made more
 trades who would have he had traded would he have made fewer trades
 who should have been traded

i think threeheaded gms guiding principle keep veterans
 favor youngsters only offered significant advantage
 end last season contracts several veterans somewhat
maginal contributions fenton bozek anderson couple others i
cant remember were bought out idea youngsters could
play almost well had potential improve where 
older guys did 
 traded mullen because he wanted go because he
wasnt good enough i think were bit too optimistic
 thinking could make up his contributions
 example from season skriko brought trial basis
 kept because his age i thought he decent
contributor worth keeping around

 youth movement has its advantages look gaudreau who
might still kc more veterans had been kept around 
you have find right balance
