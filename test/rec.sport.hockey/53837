those who wondering what happening minnesota

 from what i have seen local news tv newspaper various people 
 area trying get new hockey team columnist st 
paul pioneer press wrote article giving inside scoop 
issue three local sites competing team three possible 
candiates move twin cities first sites target center civic 
center st paul yes even met center columnist pretty 
confident minnesota get team target center 
ultimately win out he argued however competition from other 
two sites delay process considerably without 
intersite competition columnist sorry i cant remember his name 
believes minnesota would have team season also 
because situation timberwolves things delayed 
until unless city minneapolis takes over target center 
however unlikely do so until met center destroyed 
because city lose money competition from met 
conventions shortterm events even hockey target add 
 mess study months going conducted future 
viability met center which obviously delays process even 
further i hope study cancelled which have effect 
knocking met center out running perhaps encouraging 
minneapolis take over target center sooner city would 
 even more encourged wrecking ball taken met 
which may happen
regarding possible candidates three teams 
hartford tampa bay new jersey i would prefer devils minnesota 
ice demons although lightning may have potential although hasnt 
been announced yet looks like neutral site games played 
target center next year apparently devils interested playing 
 many those six games possible i wouldnt surprised see 
hartford tampa show up eitherso minnesota may end up 
getting another team may take few years
