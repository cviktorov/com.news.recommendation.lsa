i cant believe espn making sportschannel america look good

 only nynj philadelphia chicago everywhere else only
reason sportschannel available local baseball broadcasts

yes point welltaken however even areas finally got
some games theres something nagging back your skull when
 network has national rights its pocket says its
sports news theres awesome overtime going quebec city
 well try get you update through show when you
know its satellites feedhorn somewhere up 

 people want hockey tv should watch hockey tv i bet 
 ratings hockey sunday abc went toilet 

from todays times abc got great ratings chicago st louis 
 kingsflames got west coast only 
 metro new york ie devils squandered newfound support
from year ago when played rangers comparison
seniors golf did better 

next week far fewer abc affiliates hockey

i fear overall national numbers so great 
i cant tell abc did any advance marketing cos i dont
watch much tv nhl should have made sure solid
 cable before going air even espn couldve sold second
rights third party systems ie nonsportschannel since 
 making any extra money sitting games hockey
fans necessarily watching preseason beach volleyball
 playoffs games arent being shown somewhere
