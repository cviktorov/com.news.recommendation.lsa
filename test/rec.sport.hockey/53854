 need letdown wed have kept working would have
ended everyone would happy

instead lot players were happy just make playoffs
we won thats all matters said brett hull scoreless minus
 night once we got up really tough play

some players didnt have problem

just because score announced our line didnt quit said rich
sutter who played bassen miller we still had game play you
cant allow five goals like we did thats right

 disappointing see what going 

bassen almost frantic bench because blues effort somehow
he missed announcement minnesotas loss

 letdown precisely reason berry had instructed scoreboard
operators keep minnesotadetroit score off board score
showed until first popped up detroit leading third
period blues already led time

i told them i didnt want see score i didnt want know score

bother blues detroit led he worried blues might quit
