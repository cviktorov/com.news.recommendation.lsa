let me give my two cents worth whole thing

 i am very sick pittsburg fansand my second favorite team 
talk about how why cant bruins forget about ulf samuelsson when we have
forgotten all about adam graves beside obvious fact lemeuixs career
 never endangered graves slash while neely still bother his injury
i think most important reason 

 adam graves has played clean hockey ever since while ulf samulesson
 continues play dirtyyes trying hit player where hes injured
 dirty fans have can forget about one dirty play how can you
 forget about ulf samulesson when everynight when i watch hockey high
 lights i get reminded how dirty he 

hitting player when hes injured dirty can you explain statement
do you mean player who just injured ice do you mean player
who playing hurt player hurt he should bother playing because
i dont belive any player should let up just because playing
hurt

im ulf fan least i can spot fact he like calgarys
theoren fleury respect part his game really piss other
players off thats part his job he lacks ulfs size

i am ulf pgh fan what pisses me off about whole adam graves
ulf samuesson debate ulf plays hardhitting hockey nothing wrong 
 while graves does what he does when only way win game 
intentionally hurt someone which bites

players really piss me off ones who insist hitting from behind
 try go knees injure players kind garbage has
got go i would really like see muni get pasted he one 
worst offenders

i thought had instituted all kinds new rules season stop crap 
like just me does officiating just still stink high
heaven imho could get rid existing refs institute new
system more than one ref ice keep eye troublemakers
 lot things would stop game would ruled 
finnesse players mario selanne bure messier etal
