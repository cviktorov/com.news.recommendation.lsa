 netterfan watching sharks including me knows where depalma 
 end season sharks appeared still have his rights he
wasnt san jose he wasnt kansas city his name hasnt appeared 
 waiver wire

sorry nelson you forgot ask me you check thn stats 
kansas city youll find larry has been playing games having
played games period covered stats between 
 issue pim exactly invisible

he sent down 
kansas city walked out from suspended later reinstated
when revealed he injured he promptly disappeared from
 watching eyes shark bytes mailing list now known sharks
officials faithful neither sharks nor we miss him

well having gotten chance talk him few times isnt quite
accurate he injured his back disk injury did one stupid thing
which hide from sharks he tried play through because
he knew he bubble sharks sent him kc which
point he disclosed injury since he didnt disclose sharks 
he disagreed about responsibility he suspended 
reporting eventually worked out sharks reinstated him 
injured put him therapy when he able play shipped
him down kc he fully expects play nhl again although clearly
 sharks hiding injuries stupid nono beyond just 
nono

very nice guy always hustled his butt off he disappeared because he 
hurt i expect hell surface another team some point probably
another expansion team likely bubble player rest 
his career has good work ethic good getting other players
motivated unfortunately he played himself out sharks future 
bad judgement call


john carterseason th
acquired free agent from boston
gradei bb

 he
 very unlikely back next season

always gave best work ethic club except maybe kisio 
hustle isnt always enough his future sharks made clear me
one night against flames when he went behind crease tried 
hold joel otto against board he literally had one arm around ottos
neck another wrapped around ottos stick arm otto casually turned
around fed puck front crease goal though carter
wasnt hustle can only cover size so far

 sharks have told me point blank hes gone good ditto hubie
mcdonough he one favorites staff one said me
you have make room kids carter fact refused report 
kc has been suspended sharks might defacto
retirement i havent heard anything official his only hope hockey
now gulls

jeanfrancois quintinseason st
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradei bb

i dont understand why sharks didnt let quintin play any more than 
 games he played season

because least from games i saw him he outmatched looked
fairly lost ice i think he shows potential i didnt think he
 quite ready make jump nhl

 he should solid contender regular duty next season

agreed btw i still think lot your grades more based how you
wish theyd performed than how actually performed i wonder whether you
can really judge talent from radio television nelson i know i have
trouble since you dont see offpuck action your views from home 
my views from ice differ numerous ways

acquiredrd round pick entry draft

i have been accused knocking wood too much

you nah 

he seriously unimpressive even tough guy his rep however 
few games he had season point meaningless i hate
 judge talent too quickly butn dodys case im tempted make 
exception
