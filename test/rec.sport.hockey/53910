fun time year im stauber said some emotion monday i
think i have worked hard enough 

stauber said he accepts melroses choice kelly hrudey teams top goalie
 playoff series calgary flames hrudey made saves sundays
 opening victory

 stauber clearly upset his sudden status man behind rick
knickle stauber had record goalsagainst average down 
stretch regular season nearly wrestled job from hrudey

knickle he won decisions had bloated average twice 
yanked from games once stomach cramps hasnt played since march 

yet when series resumes wednesday knickle serve hrudeys backup
again stauber have satisfy his playoff hunger munching olympic
saddledome popcorn

 im supposedly close being starter could have been starteri
dropped too what happened stauber wondered id 
happy i feel i should least part team 
playoffs

perhaps stauber eventually get his chance melrose apparently 
convinced year old capable handling playoff pressure

while insisting he kings goalie future melrose said stauber
flubbed all four big games he asked win season were
according melrose loss san jose dec loss new
york rangers jan tie detroit feb loss 
vancouver thursday

four times season robb could have emerged elite goalie he could
have taken away from kelly hrudey he didnt do melrose said 
elite goaltender has carry ball when you give him mark 
great goalie he isnt satisfied backup

im blaming robb losses youre going youve
got able walk your talk youve got able play when everything
 line robb stauber has great deal ability maybe i expect
more from him than he does

ouch remark stung stauber he began season struggled when 
team hit midseason slump didnt play month after knickle signed
off san diego gulls roster came end

expect lot from myself otherwise i wouldnt here

anybody who would disagree doesnt know me im saying barry 
doesnt know me dont say ive been without expectations anything im
 perfectionist

stauber acknowledged he played poorly four games melrose mentioned 
even though i didnt play well i get knocked down from maybe three its 
 bit jump he said youre almost you play good game 
youre you dont youre why does jack nicklaus shoot
