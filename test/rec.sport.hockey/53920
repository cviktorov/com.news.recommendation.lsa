 whats going russians czechs unable beat easy
opponents swedes beat austria only 

 its openinggame effect maybe pros arrive late nervousness 
 rookie wc players problems get lines clicking may make things
 hard get going against worse nations
 id guess better team you face opening game better
 since chances upset greater 

 some other reasons why worse teams so tough beat presented
 hans virus lindberg former coach switzerland

 worse teams referring france switzerland austria italy etc
 have now usually world class goalies

 defensive play have become much more disciplined take much
 less unnecessary penalties

 use four lines which makes harder make them run out gas

 ice quality german wc rinks poor

 only convincing winner germany wierd

 another weird thing czechs played entertaining hockey
