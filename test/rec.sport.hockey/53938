quebec dominated habs first periods only roy kept
 one from being rout although he did blow nd goal
canadians showed up third nords were playing dump 
pull back most time

do you notice nobody team willing take charge
 dominant defenceman would nicetoo bad schneider got hurt
he reminds me chris chelios sometimes speaking chelios i 
wonder serge savard feels like moron making trade
i also wish we still had corson

rob ramage ice less useful than gatorade bottle 
bench

vincent damphousse has decided take vacation apparently i have
 idea why demers playing denis savard checking line 
carbonneau savard skating well one only dangerous
canadiens quebecs zone puck too bad nobody front
most time

do you also notice defensive zone single nordique
gets knocked down its disgusting we also have lebeau 
getting pasted centre ice wolaninn reply
from team except yell penalty dammit denis savard 
threw best only montreal hit night when he knocked
sundin offbalance when denis savard your teams enforcer theres
big trouble someplace

hextall made some good saves 
really one lost first period when nords scored 
 could have had plus another nd

aside from second goal roy did stand his head third 
period least provided something look forward habs won 
period imo i guess somebody finally came along smack them 
couple times second intermission remind them game
had started hopefully play way home roy made 
 saves well ignore second goal so now its up team
