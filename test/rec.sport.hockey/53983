finland 
 
 djyrki lumme
 dteppo numminen
 dpeter ahola
 
well well dont like our defenders mainly lumme numminen

 cjari kurri
 cchristian ruuttu
 
now do you think ruuttu only worth i think might 

 rteemu selanne
 
compared kurri selannes points too high lets make 


 well canada cup world championships largely due efforts 
 markus ketterer goalie players listed above luck theres
 presumably lot decent players finland wouldnt superstars 
 highest level still valuable role players however my guess would 
 finnish canada cup team would team nhl

wow now looks like you dont like our players what about guys like
nieminen jutila riihijarvi varvio laukkanen makela keskinen even
 he aging ruotsalainen main difference between finnish north
american players our players tend better larger rink
 canadian defenders usually slower defenders europe 
 i think more our success than ketterer luck though
 helped i think main reason team worked well
together
