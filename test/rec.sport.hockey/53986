comments shick pocketed whistle third allowing lot 
clutching grabbing buffalos penalty killing unit fantastic
again mogilny checking granted he missed once instead
flung his body boards checking like novel idea
 mogilny crowd unbelievable i dont think ive ever
heard crowd loud aud sabres game remember i 
only five when played cup i dont remember 
one took me games doug bodger postgame interview
noted he tried say something hawerchuk crowd 
too loud even though he shouting didnt seem matter 
most sabres even muckler said great yuri khmylev
didnt seem realize he games third star didnt
skate out when his name called sweeney fuhr each
were out before yuri made his appearance sans jersey when asked 
 interview later whether he knew how big goal he
responed yes ok through interpreter he said more than
 even more than interpreter said i digress 
interviewer seemed think just because he doesnt speak english he
must understand playoffs uhhuh
