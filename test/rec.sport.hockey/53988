 other hand im hard pressed think any other real mistakes
fereirra made imagine indeed again we have benefit 
hindsight

well jettison youth fast strategy his also hindsight 
didnt work all well i think more because left 
sharks tightrope without net inherently flawed 
 injuries caused us fall

lets say view sharks upper management attempt
 trade kisio major factor decision fire feirerra

from all indications wasnt major factor last straw
 were personality conflicts among shark management disagreements
over how personnel were going handled just who being traded
vs kept who being sent kc what ferriera did rumors 
right always what folks behind bench wanted needed

im inclined take exactly opposite view should have kept
himhes obviously luckiest man hockey

i think theyd kept ferriera would have lost some other
management staff depending which sources you trust we might have lost
grillo lombardi murdoch over summer frankly i want keep
those three we may well ahve also lost kingston which course now
 moot point 

 sharks have been building organizational staff highly
consensual cooperative ferriera wanted run things his way 
were conflicts ferriera lost says nothing about his skills 
accomplishments level lot personality politics 

i think he did some good things sharks he never fit 
 shark person i hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down 
anaheim too because itll good hockey i want ducks 
doormats couple years so sharks succeeed first
