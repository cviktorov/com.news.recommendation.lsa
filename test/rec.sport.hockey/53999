during first three games pensdevils series i have been
impressed time time again pure talent pens jagr
maceachern barrasso have been especially fun watch one
element team which goes unnoticed seems scotty bowman

despite brooks lunatic comments despite devils line changing
adantage last nights game bowman has been able keep his cool 
keep devils dark granted helldwellers had pens
bottled up while last night bowman eventually able 
configure his lineup get job done his ability throw out new
looks strategies moments notice incredible

bowman seems have terrific ability reading his players 
individual basis last night instance he realized speed
 jagr straka maceachern throwing devils off balance 
 result straka received many more shifts than average jagr played
almost entire game he always puck maceachern
scored goal while complementing jagr many times throughout night
his ability commit one player crucial situations 
commendable especially when coach talented team might
simply rely overall talent dominate bring about
success

while one can replace genius optimism badger bob johnson
bowman his own way has made himself permanent though clearly
