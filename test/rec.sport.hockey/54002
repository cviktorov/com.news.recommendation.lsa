dino getting shots front net he should expect playoff
hockey where anything goes you lose one game regular season its
 so bad you lose game playoffs its difficult thing 
overcome ive watched hockey played too number years 
i havent seen one postseason game where forward front net 
has finished without any bruises back his leg leafs 
 doing good job clearing net potvin has been forced take
matters his own hands i remember when cicarelli used play 
london knights ohl he always nuisance front net 
goalies took exception he also complained mornings paper
about what happened last night me its lot bellyaching his 
team up he complains about being whackedi wonder what would
happen he tried do same thing front billy smith younger
ron hextall seems dino would need two artifical legs dino should take 
 part game thank his lucky stars hes playoffs 
has good chance go finals


well i agree youre going stand front net
 you should expect get hit hacked general you
should expect finish game some bruises however
 fine line between hacking guy causing some pain
 discomfort blatantly attempting injure another
player felix potvin imo crossed line wednesday 
two hander ciccarelli way out line i lost lot 
respect potvin because showed immaturity he
did slash ciccarelli simply try remove him from 
slot area legal position dino instead he
slashed attempt injure out shear frustration 
leaf supporter just supporter im leaf fan really i
 very disappointed

youre right mentioning billy smith ron hextall least
 his philly days both crossed same line times 
 reason many fans players disliked them thats
why names always comes up examples when we talk about
 issues lets hope felix doesnt do again id
hate see anyone even dino although i admit i dont like
him very much get seriously hurt from careless 
intentional use stick

gary
