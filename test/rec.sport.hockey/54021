stuff deleted

when quinn took over vancouver several years ago last year 
regularily missed playoffs i cant recall missed playoffs
 year before his hiring probably did quinn has improved 
team from nonplayoff calibre serious contender

when murray took over detroit were about team 
contender win norris division possibly even stanley cup
contender

 last year before bryan murray took over wings did make 
playoffs while had been considered possible contender when jacques
demers first arrived his last two years were respectively
embarrassed first round chicago failed make 
playoffs time might add when were only five teams 
norris

its true vancouver did make playoffs many year before 
quinn came those years smythe division loti mean lot
tougher division than norris also known snorris division
vancouver had play edmonton calgary both very legitimate stanley
cup contenders eight times year while detroit got play 
powerhouses toronto minnesota now edmonton hardly even force
 league smythe even has mighty san jose sharks while
over same period time which vancouver improving so 
everybody norris except st louis detroit had improve just
 keep up competition division had improve 
lot get better than competition norris

bryan murray inherited team very little talent really good
players had yzerman burr probert about 
 doubt some dispute whether burr probert were good 
rest were either very green rookies washed up veterans only reason
 got far did years before murray came due 
coaching demers who least first got every last ounce effort
possible out his team even his coaching began degrade

so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over gm
quinn one example better gm than murray

 number reasons why detroit wasnt bad shape standings
wise when murray took over vanc when quinn took over some which
i outlined above murray did have any better personnel work 
 outset than did quinn exception yzerman one player
cannot alone make team stanley cup contender im sure everyone
reading agree 

well able see better which team really most improved when 
face each other conference final assuming dont get knocked out
like last year
