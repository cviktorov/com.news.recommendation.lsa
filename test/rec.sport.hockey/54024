 several problems way game being presented 
fans i feel geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
more than names honouring personages

i think compromise would work namely honouring personages 
conference names using geographical references divisional 
names although i still do think move draw fans 
game imo its cosmetic change bettman owners hope 
 have effect doesnt say much mentality 
anybody works either 

another thing bothers me points system percentages used 
 other major sports clearly more informative when i look 
nhl standings first thing i have do make quick calculation 
account games hand which almost always case some 
object percentages claiming perhaps americanization
 sport

surprise i agree totally points system fine everybody all
times has played same number games since almost never 
case winning percentage way go i dont particularly care 
 american thing either works
