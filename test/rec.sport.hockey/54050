i said gund have open his checkbook i didnt say give up
any draft picks promising talent we could have gotten
murphy m great i agree sharks shouldnt give
up young talent early round draft picks i listed chelios et al
only indicate type player i think sharks need pick 
up rules signing free agents less than years old puts
 big restriction what sharks can pick up however i do
believer need pick up some players who add toughness
 team

 you have remember youre unlikely get any real quality free
agents who do require compensation sharks tried makarov who
 probably top class among noncompensation free agents even
he probably wouldnt have helped too much

dont expect get top quality just some toughness i dont
view makarov player who would add toughness

size hopefully wont much worry next year alexander cherbayev 
michal sykora have agreed multiyear contracts appears mike
rathje also sign soon all three pretty big

size alone isnt enough we all know how much fear kolstad 
struck eyes opponents 

well rathje sykora both highly touted prospects unlike kolstad
 cherbayev initially supposed play russian wc team anybody
know what happened means hes likely good enough


nelson youre confusing skill toughness


mcgillhammond johan garpenlov would you really rather have those two
instead johan

 your logic you enjoy having falloon ozolinsh 
injured reserve

 your logic you think sharks had kept mcgill hammond
 you can guarantee falloon ozolinsh wouldnt have gotten hurt
think again chance mcgill would have caused ozolinsh get
stuck kc you know hammond worthless mcgill almost
worthless

well wilson maybe i dont think falloon ozolinsh were really
injured cheapshots

who said were 

 werent i dont see any justification having mcgill 
hammond around would prevent injuries injuries falloon 
ozolinsh were purely accidental what could mcgill hammond have done
 prevent them

hey get off mcgillhammond thing im fan either my
point last year sharks had toughness missing
 year year we had more skill im all 
 your skill players keep getting beat up injured 
cant do you much good whether its cheap shot you
cant let other teams push you around sharks
simply got pushed around much other teams knew 
 knew could aggressively check sharks 
pay adding some players off season who 
add some toughness team help insure next
season other teams more hesistant vigorously 
check our skill players take cheap shots doesnt
guarantee injuries nothing does its something 
sharks can do reduce number injuries

 just say
