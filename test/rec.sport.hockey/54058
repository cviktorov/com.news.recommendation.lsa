 response debate about who has has better season jagr francis

i think jagr did he probably had better point per minute ice time stats
dont exist properly analyze he had substancially better 


 actually what i think has become more evident you determined 
 flaunt your ignorance all cost jagr did have better season than
 francis suggest otherwise insult those modicum 
 hockey knowledge save your almost maniacal devotion almighty
 plusminus most misleading hockey stat available

 until nhl publishes more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
 time per game some measure its quality ie player put out
 key situations like protecting lead late game he matched up
 against other teams top one two lines shorthanded etc i would
 much rather see disappear altogether instead having its dubious
 merits trumpeted those little understanding its implications

 useful statistic player ice when his team scores 
lot goals only allows few goals he must doing something right
 especially useful compare between teammates play 
same team should have roughly similar ratings equally
good players can adjusted varying degrees success compare
between players different teams

i agree would nice nhl keep more statistics how useful
 ones you suggest total ice time would very useful 
 missing stat jagr vs francis arguments from before somehow measuring
 quality ice time you suggest would useless would 
better stat evaluating coaching ie players given quality ice
time actually talented ones very good player could given low
amounts quality ice time because team depth stupid coach who
doesnt recognize his talent very bad player could given lots 
quality ice time because lack team depth stupid coach 
thinks he effective player stat would much more flawed than
 almost conclusions could drawn regarding player talent

 useful stat quite useful evaluating player talent
you one displaying ignorance because your unwillingness see
 being ice when goals scored when allowed
 very positive thing should evaluated
