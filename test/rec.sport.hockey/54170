 i watched game germanyczechs wc todayand i astonished about
 behaviour german audience
 german team got few penalties last period crowd went

 just those penalties most all penalty referee didnt
call czechs right before first goal

 grazy threw coins extra pucks other trash rinkis
 stupid what i guess canadian referee one 
 isostarbros gave german team penalty didnt help
 much
 i guess germans just proud over nazikillemalleveryone

dont you think its quite silly call nazi attitude when some people 
throw coins ice hey i dont approve behavior guys
especially wc game i cant see any reason using word nazi
 connection 
 
 butusgermanssucks attitudethey just seem have kind attitude
 every possible sport remember european champs stockholm soccer

soccer hooligans just german problem remember world cup italy
again theres big difference between throwing coins smashing shopwindows
 fighting other socalled fans who come wc just see 
dutch english germans best bruisers
which other sports you talking about i dont think soccer every possible
sport

 really pisses me off
 i do mean every single german has attitude sucks 
 most them seem do

how many germans do you know do you think out most them 
 you hear about some white policemen beating black man us what do you
think about americans most them like beating blacks
