so i dont know what you mean parity boston never now 
 never good organization montreal canadiens


never probably now debatable what other valid test can
you think besides final standings divisional playoff winner what
do you propose worthless vote like do college football what 
joke

you boston fans make me laugh youre going crazy based very 
recent boston domination over montreal playoffs i mean how 
many cups has boston won compared montreals who do you 
think going win next cup between teams montreal 
 boston you know sindens going find some way screwing up 
even good boston team hell fire suter trade away vital 
star admittedly his last few trades have been good ones how 
long before his luck runs out he starts making espositofor
ratelle type trades again 


 i remember right brad park also involved trade he wasnt
all bad hockey player

 lets look some sindens trades over years

 rick middleton rangers i dont know who sinden gave up middle
ton so ill call one 

barry pederson cam neely canucks any questions

greg hawgood vladimir ruzicka oilers didja see one rosie
roofed against roy last years playoffs

courtnallranford andy moog oilers wash moog good goaltender
ranford burned boston finals his first year courtnall always
seems get his points anyone vancouver care comment courtnall
 defensive liability

ken linseman dave poulin flyers any more questions

janneyquintal adam oates blues janney enormous talent 
 personable guy bruins play adams division enough said

soeven you count espositovadnaisratelleparki dont remember who 
else joe zanussi trade double minus harry horse trader comes
out top i submit bruins always good because harry 
 spite him

btw do you really think habs bounce back next season ill bet 
 finish fourth fifth conference behind any following
pittsburgh quebec boston washington islanders someone correct me 
 five teams montreals conference

 summary things look bleak habs least near future i
suspect next team from la belle province win cup 
 team lindros didnt want play 

i admit ive been suffering lately boston gets hot while 
montreal swans playoffs type years i do have sure 
knowledge montreal braintrust keep plugging away until 
 hit right formula yet another cup whereas i were 
boston fan id have kind despair long harry sinden 
 running show bruins always good never 
good enough
