peter aholaseason nd
acquired trade pittsburgh future considerations
gradei b

 way too early tell about ahola who acquired probably because 
penguins figured would lose him expansion draft ahola had
only played games season i think its actually less san jose
mercury news may err here them sharks games he
has played he appeared quite solid defensively although he hasnt been
spectacular his offense isnt anything write home about points
its even possible trade may future considerations which turn
out peter ahola

doug wilsonseason th
acquired trade chicago rw kerry toporowski 
nd round pick entry draft
gradei b

i have often been accused overly down wilson i may have had too high
expectations him his legs knees et al giving out
nevertheless when he playing he exhibited strong shooting 
playmaking abilities even he has lost step defense which
unfortunately he demonstrated year well times he slow 
catch opponent forwards his offensive output only good enough 
nd place team points games next year which may 
wilsons last he can stay healthy he can still contributor

dean kolstadseasonnd
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradei cd

its probably somewhat unfair me judge kolstad just handful 
games forgetting exact number more than age hes
quickly running out time he wants make nhl those games
he did impress anyone after generating shots first period 
 first game he played he scored just points his tenure up here 
 sharks even less impressive defensively he appeared awkward
 his movement prone giveaways he needs make leap 
his level performance have any chance making team

pat macleodseason nd
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradei 

macleod roster lot longer than kolstad appears my
memory he played less than kolstad because sharks were reluctant 
use him were even more reluctant send him minors figuring 
he wouldnt clear waivers fact he has played past weeks 
kansas city still technically rehabilitation assignment
 rehab assignment include him playing turner cup playoffs
since he has played so little i cant even give tentative grade him 
he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills terrible defensive
skills

tom pedersonseason st
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradei b

called up middle season when defensive corps decimated
 injuries pederson impressed many sharks fan here net including yours
truly he demonstrated very good offensive skills scoring points 
 games however his size lbs concern soon after
he began shine offensive did teams begin push him around physically
 both sides ice although he had appeared fearless his approach
 successful he probably needs bulk up have fighting chance
 surviving against some bigger players league

claudio screminseason st
acquired from minnesota dispersal draft
gradei dd

he played all games league year thoroughly
umimpressive just he end last season again may 
small sample just case kolstad scremin age 
quickly running out time he contributor either offense 
defense games he played sharks only notable thing 
 go down scremins entry league stats probably fact he
 once traded now capitals goaltender don beaupre
