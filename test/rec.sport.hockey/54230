 i heard story local sports news broadcast edmonton
 oiler owner peter pocklington holding press conference
 next week while exact details known believed
 concern oilers future

 rumour has pocklington signed tentative lease arrangement
 copps collesium hamilton during press conference
 pocklington may announce deal quite possible 
 deal may simply way force edmonton northlands 
 renegotiate oiler lease stadium

 northlands has offered buy oilers million earlier
 offer rejected immediately pocklington

 me my opinion divided edmonton has been fairly
 supportive oilers even though theyre small market
 team had many sellouts s even problems
 team had year still brought more fans
 than many teams larger cities did other hand 
 team does move place more deserving than
 hamilton course how would affect grand
 realignment scheme bettman


 following up provincial government has been asked 
opposition block any deal pocklington offering hamilton 
government said pock going nowhere

 why dont i believe government wasnt pocklington who wanted 
tory leader years ago
