wood played most his junior career seattle he one
 leading scorers mediocre team when he traded away 
 he rarely lost fight one toughest players 
 whl

wood fairly small enforcertype i mean fleury does pretty good
job isnt large dody fleury 

having been witness three four his fights closeup he simply isnt
ready fight nhl level assuming its his role which all he
really showed us his few games up from kc he can pass shoot 
skate i never saw much all he has right fist which isnt bad
 nhl level other players smart enough grab thing
before he can land anything significant once you control hand hes 
fish flopping beach other player can do just about anything
he wants him his entire strategy seemed keep hand out reach
until he found opening i never once saw him find opening worth
talking about he got neutralized quickly stomped couple times

unless he shows some new tricks camp hell my career minor
leaguer list since his first taste nhl i expect 
sharks gave him so hed know what hed have work offseason he
needs get stronger he needs get more speed he needs show some
versatility something else than simply goond because he wasnt
particularly good goon
