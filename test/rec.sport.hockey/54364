wayne made his own bedchoosing mcnall over sather hockey
destinyhe should sleep instead whining ego got

absolute nonsense decision made pocklingtons he chose 
 mill over gretzky gretzky wasnt upset about being able win
 cup la i submit he wasnt worth mill

 best himhe thought supporting cast edmonton
didnt matterthat he show himself

how do you know what he thinks thought only thought i
can see you have revealed your own you dont like gretzky
big deal

now my only complaint about lemieux he dives too much
 last year patrick convinced him twice accept bowman hockey
destiny rather than his ego

 real purpose diving merely attempt draw penalty what
 player trying do make checkers keep distance so 
ref wont fooled i cant imagine why anyone would expect someone like
lemieux change his game why dont you pick dimensional overrated
type like hull salami
