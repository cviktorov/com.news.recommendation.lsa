 i dont think sharks should dig free agent market most 
 good free agents require quite bit compensation set 
 sharks back far player development goes remember sharks were
 unwilling give up players addition million offered 
 joe murphy i think thats good approach tried sign sergei
 makarov before season because makarov wouldnt have required compensation

matching makarov offer only real mistake dave king has made 
year i have wonder about intelligence signing year old who
 obviously downside his career year million contract 
risebrough matched offer kings request makarov has spent last
quarter season press box because his work ethic just plain
stinks mention hes lost step can longer get himself
 position make nifty passes 

i think makarov available free offseason anybody who agrees
 pay his contract hes ineffective calgary he might able help
 team like san jose shortage talent theres takers 
makarov doesnt show improvement training camp i think flames just
bite bullet buy out makarovs contract release him his
current attitude he detriment team
