 thing confuses me most about espn decided show 
penguins devils again thursday night being both first 
two games were dominated pitt you would think would show 
different game addition fact should show other 
games just sake fair exposure

nesn owns rights bruin telecasts i suspect nesn only
going sell one telecast espn remember espn only owns exclusive
rights finals entire playoffs since espn bought 
sca contract less wrangles untie showing devils
 penguins


also some you should know far i can tell espn going 
 show campbell conference games regularly first two rounds i 
believe only going show campbell games first two 
rounds those series wear games perhaps games 


i think same broadcast rights factor comes plus 
have way fitting western game times current schedule
unless nhl willing make western club move up game
i think nhl got much could when shuffled deck abc

also does anyone have info abc coverage sunday 



same exact coverage last week pitnj game east chistl
 central lacgy mountains west
