you along mario lemieux must from another planet only
difference lemieux comes from one geo washington abe
lincoln many other great men women world whereas you come
from one david koresh yeah mario good drawing penalties
 wouldnt you try do something you do claim play give your team
 advantage i dont remember lemieux getting any diving penalties 
year whereas many others did finally mario has never complained about
being hit he knows its part game he gets back dishing out 
even bigger hit same guy just scoring few goals setting
them up dont you have any compassion man who has gone through so
much his life
