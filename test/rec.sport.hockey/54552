 probability oilers going anywhere

 gerald look what happened stars off dallas


pocklington has chosen moment make his last stand 
because he moment maximum advantagethe provincial
government months away from provincial electionit 
 moment when he has maximum power convince northlands
 give him better arena deal better purchase price
 before nhls new collective agreement 
 players which might involve some enhanced revenuesharing

gerald alberta election slated fou june unless something really goes 
wrong time pocklington could end up being embarassment klein
 he goes ahead his ultimatum


pocklington many thingsstupid one them

gerald people still have axe grind guy i cannot see him staying long

he can dictate termsbecause other cities pay his
price edmonton doesnt

 people edmonton wont budge trust me one

edmonton has already up its international airport 
surrendered supremacy calgary over next few years
edmonton going take hard hit from government cutbacks
 screw itself beyond recogniton manages find
 way lose its hockey team toobecause northlands wants
 continue use oilers subsidize horse racing

northlands wont budge ccording one board members bruce campbell

however case about longterm financial
viability oilers fact pocklington basically 
right regardless who owns team right provoke
 crisis now before team accumulates millions dollars
 losses becomes habitually uncompetitive because lack
 money

i havent heard anything attendance coliseum lowest 
year hinthint remeber what i said about personal vendetta

sather has done his jobthe oilers poised competitive
again very soon al strachan one most knowledgeble hockey
writers canada postmortem oilers season 
 globe mail recently agrees me

gerald dont blame sather battle between peole pocklington
started got worst when pocklington sold gretzky 

 were days when you can shake hand pocklington when he 
respectalbe i use do so season those days goe
