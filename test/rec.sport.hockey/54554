 first time i heard piece news post game radio
interview here jyvaskyla bronze medal game 
smliiga which tichonovs team porin assat aces town pori
lost vasili son victor tichonov famous soviet coach
said long time sharks have been persuading him 
take assistant coach post he wants head coach where
ever he goes he definitely wont coaching assat anymore after
three seasons i dont know why

vasili good coach i believe assat good team produced many
players our national team assat wasnt skilled team imho 
 had fighting spirit after all butchered jokerit 
playoffs gave hard time tps champs assat wasnt
consistent only when were right mood could beat any
team smliiga

decide during wc i doubt he head coach 
maybe theyll do some compromise
