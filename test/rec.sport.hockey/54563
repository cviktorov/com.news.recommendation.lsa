many people have suggested fuhrs play only reason 
sabres beat bruins while fuhr critical factor i would 
overlook fact sabres finally got some scoring from people other 
than mogilny lafontaine khmylev sweeney hawerchuck etc indeed 
lafontaine played hurt didnt score many goals also team played 
better defense although great than regular season fuhr 
deserves lot credit all 

robert 

i agree i also think fuhrs contribution sabress win just
 same many palyers team mogilny had six goals four games
including two goals great comeback final win after fuhr had
left key sabress win over boston whole teams strong commitment
 underdog all talent players including mogilny fuhr


i think grant fuhr deserves more credit than 
while its true entire sabres team played very well i
still believe wasnt grant fuhr series would
now tied he virtually stole games sabres
 both games fuhr stood his head give sabres
 chance win especially game fuhr made series 
huge stops third period when score tied 
even game when sabres won score seemed 
indicate sabres dominated however hadnt been
 fuhr sabres wouldnt have been up i think 
through nd period bruins wouldnt have had open
up game thereby allowing mogilny score third goal 
 breakaway salt away game 
 doubt my mind fuhr critical factor 
victory 

 my opinion neely oates juneau played well 
lafontaine mogilny hawerchuk sabres did get
extraordinary efforts from hannan sweeney wood khmylev
compared bruins checkers however bruins defense
 imo played better than sabres defense sabres have ken sutton
playing regular shift afterall 
 difference series fuhr who outplayed andy moog 

gary

go sabres
