 last nights game toronto received five penalties detroit none 


 
 which game were you watching didnt you see third period when
 wings had penalties called them delayed penalty
 leafs had man advantage about minute man advantage
 another minute two leafs still couldnt score
 i wonder how leafs scored powerplay goal according
 you never had powerplay
 detroit paper today said were penalties called 
last nights game youre saying detroit had none those penalties
im guessing you only watched first period i have admitt leafs
did get alot penalties period where wings didnt get
many any all havent looked box scores yet 
ref more than made up third period

go wings

my apologies typo i meant wings had power plays 
first period leafs none 

 well my point isnt refs were biased just were
calling lot penalties which works benefit wings

having ref call whole bunch penalties against one team 
calling bunch against other make up takes lot away
from what could have been great game
