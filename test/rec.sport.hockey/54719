 once again leafs overcame red wings what possibly 
 most exciting game played yet playoff year

perhaps most exciting game played yet you have seen 
most us who watch teams around league interest objectivity 
 nowhere near most exciting game

paul stewart called single worst game ive seen year 
federovs major obvious i dont dispute however chaissons 
penalty shouldnt even have been penalty let alone major 
game misconduct minute game misc call high sticking only 
 blood penalty just because chaisson barely touched 
poor sap he hit dasher bled profusely doesnt mean 
penalty 

unfortunately instant replay used hits first i
immediately thought game because hit looked much more severe
from intenttoinjure perspective than after seeing replay
id say deserved minutes boarding careless any way you 
slice stewart had replay i do think chaisson would have gotten
 game

 second period behind potvin probert had puck 
going get out front tackled i couldnt believe nocall

 nocall bullshit i agree i admire stewart letting them go 
probert looked up saying where hell penalty ive never
seen probert whine either he doesnt need now probie
decides put wendel through boards hes probably gone right

i dont remember who leafs touched puck 
 racines shot towards end game seconds left stewart
called out play last touched detroit everybody garden
including linesmen knew yzerman protested stewart just 
laughed really homered wings

 also bullshit once again replay rouse btw im
really pissed linesmen didnt correct call eitherits bs
when officials refuse admit made mistake 

 when all comes down wings played like shit

yes calls you describe should have difference detroit
loss i picked leafs win game emotion adrenalin 
wings have excuses game should superior team

 call pissed me off most anderson getting putting his
stick somebodys eye most dangerous stick infraction i
have seen long time everybody damn league knows hes 
asshole when comes stickwork four lousy minutes bullshit call 
murray should send tape wing should hammer living shit out
 him
