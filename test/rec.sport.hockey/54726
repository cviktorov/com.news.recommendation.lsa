amongst penguins fans seems inner calm ive never
experienced before year pens players fans have so
much confidence team year were savoring every game saving
our energy stanley cup

thats good way put its quiet confidence i dont feel like
i have defend team anymore 

 devils puzzle me have long been one few teams
i always dreaded playing d isnt quite what used 
still usually play us pretty tough i just cant figure out least
last night mounted attack

 watching some devils players being interviewed i could
 see faces eyes really dont have any
 confidence left speechless when asked what more 
 can do beat pens act though know its
 hopeless task

bernie nichols interviewed after game late news he 
shaking his head disbelief over barrasso saying tommy like
another defenseman out how difficult playing against him
 he got faraway look his face his voice started trailing
off he said just isnt rightit just isnt fair he
tried muster smile

im really impressed bowmans coaching tactics hes had answer 
every move brooks has thrown pens

 far coaching goes pensislanders matchup should pretty good

one guy i feel sorry all so far chris terreri im sure
tom barrasso knows how he feels so long tommy would look up 
have teammate sight terreris teammates really left him out 
cold first two games
