moderated group moderated anallyretentive little
dullard like yourself 

look several ways state opposing viewpoint three
 come mind follows

i hardly need you presume lecture me how communicate my points
 view posting you have made second subject 
 nhl letter you have yet communicate your opinion matter
instead you content yourself flaming me

 say directly obnoxiously result

result
moronic little busy bodies like yourself take advantage perceived
opportunity post rules others live 

you realize anything you say can most certainly 
used against you

significance all means go ahead i insist otherwise why dont
you just go back sleep do whatever you do when you 
all yourself
