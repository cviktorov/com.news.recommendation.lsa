okay caps again about break out golf clubs before 
do does anyone have history washington capitals futility
record playoffs i remember terrys first year first
year caps finally made third round before under
brian i noticed every other year caps got second round
 years between didnt make past first round 
trend continuning 
 trend caps were done goneso five games saves
us caps fans lot pain

i mean would more painful caps were up watching them 
tumbled when need one more win clinch series how many times
have done history

 up five game series against isles lost straight
 up against isles lost straight
 up against pens lost straight

 other words when were about clinch games go 
were pitiful lone wins being 

 sweep philly 
 win against rangers patrick finals only time 
 managed get out division

actually saturdays blown lead wasnt anything new we all know caps
 famous lead blowers crucial playoff games examples

 game against isles led after two lead series 
gave up goals rd period including game winning goal 
last minute after goal bobby carpenter botched penalty shot
series tied lost game few days later

 game against rangers led series led rd 
period blew lost game ot three consecutive games

 game against pittsurgh led series led nd period
blew series

 game against isles series tied led after blew 

 game against isles trailed series led nd period
blew again

when were leading game i said myself blew 
lead series over have lost all momemtum islanders
believe can come back matter what score 

i am still waiting cap goalie who can carry team who can 
completely shut down opposition when hanging dear 
lives crucial game

 admiral hopeless caps fan
ps we still remember ot loss islanders aurggghhhhhhhhh
well some teams have some teams just dont when caps
were frustrated year year out islanders i thinking wait
until potvinbossytrottiersmith retire well retired even though
trottier still able haunt caps pens uniform yet another
generation islanders were still doing same thing well i guess 
 has nothing do players
