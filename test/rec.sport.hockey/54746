i dont think hes shown hes good enough carry detroit cup
 team may good enough reach finals cheveldae 
achilles heel you must have goaltending playoffs 
cheveldae looks like overmatched nd rd stringer which he probably
 
 i guess i dont know too many nd rd string goalies could post
 over wins season chevy has done past two seasons playing 
 behind defense exactly best league his wins 
 year were all against toronto those who look vincent rien
 stats think he should starting take look teams he played
 against teams like san jose ottawa tb any nhl goalie could post decent
 record playing teams like night night out
 
 look detroit management remedy situation offseason
 
 i really dont see happening didnt think cheveldae could do 
 job would traded somebody year after all why wait until next
 year when were goalies available year
 
hey i may wrong after watching him kick rebound after rebound 
 high slot i dont think he can carry them tough games ie
those against toronto
 
 better kick out rebounds than let goals 

 st louis gets past chicago watch joseph carry blues past
 otherwise vastly superior red wings club

 joseph hot so wings have scored six goals both 
 games so far toronto supposively one leagues best defenses
 i guess end up playing norris title well see what happens

 wings hopefully 


 far cheveldae concerned he decent goalie most logical
trade offseason me would between detroit ny rangers im sure
 beezer would traded he would enjoy opportunity go back his
roots detroit he would valuable asset wings perhaps 
rangers could get zombo return beezer got few good years him 
 opportunity get fresh start would energize his play
