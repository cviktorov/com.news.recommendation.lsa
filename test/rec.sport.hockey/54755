 id like echo sentiments worst coverage i can
 ever remember seeing cbc soon game ends i can count 
 time theyve signed off air post game interviews
 updating late scores nothin tsn really putting cbc 
 shame i only hope later round coverage improves i mean who
 really wants see cbc primetime news instead hockey

 my 
 darren

 concession mansbridge cbc news argued youre
going play havoc schedule you should least make sure 
prime time aired soon possible news got commitment 
postgame show would scrapped network would go ptn within
one minute so game ending

 earlier comments about cbc being ontariocentric frankly
 doubleheader decison goes both ways people west cant see
 leafs people central canada cant see jets game 
reason decision cbcs feeling couldnt sell advertising
 six hours hockey one night

 who wants see news over hockey lot people cbc always gets
plenty complaints about juggling news schedule
