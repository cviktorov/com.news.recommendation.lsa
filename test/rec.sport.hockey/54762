stuff deleted

 example look pat quinn canucks i am saying
 he best gm merely better one than murray 
one i am very familiar 

he traded
garth butcher good player dan quinn nhl anymore
 st louis cliff ronning geoff courtnall sergio mommesso 
robert dirk too good true right

i think goes along comment you made earlier post 
namely quinn taking advantage major league bonehead gm
 st louis trade absolutely stupid trade st louis
 only stupid trade guy made we can give
quinn credit being opportunist here

stuff about other trades deleted

plus his team has improved much greater amount than detroit since
he took over them

how do you figure both vancouver detroit did same thing last year
 both won division had close same number points
 both went down first round playoffs before finally
escaping games both got knocked out second round 
teams should have been able beat less talent specifically
 i remember correctly third place teams how does make vancouver
more improved further im mistaken wings had more points than
vancouver end season albeit many
