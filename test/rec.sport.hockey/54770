here something crossposted from ahl mailing list

 discussion between me chris lerch subject springfields 
st round upset providence bruins
came up chris basically raised possibility ahl 
hierarchy biased favor indians he noted offices
 league spring many exindians working ahl
furthermore he also informed me back few years ago cup 
finals between roch spring amerks charged favoritism office
 

 were little questionable things liket he ahl president 
staff attending all games springfield brass including sitting
 box game springfield according rochester
media openly cheering springfield

certainly something quite serious any 
 true i dont know anything more than whining 
part amerks have pulled sort crap against 
wings before true somthing seriously raises
questions about president jack butterfields leadership
